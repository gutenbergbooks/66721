<small>AN ENCOUNTER WITH CARTOUCHE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Night</span> had already come as I drew my cloak
more closely about me and stepped forth into the
street. I had lingered long over my meal, as a
man will who has been alone all the day and sees
little chance of companionship before him. For in
all the city I knew no one, and there seemed small
prospect of the night bringing any enjoyment with
it. I turned to the left, away from that dingy
house in the Rue Bailleul, which was the only home
I had thus far found in Paris, determined to forget,
for a time at least, its narrow entrance leading to
the dirty interior court, where a thousand odors
struggled ceaselessly for mastery; the dark staircase mounting
steeply upward, and the close little
room, which a single week&#8217;s occupancy had sufficed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
to render loathsome to me. Ah! it was different
from the wide, sweet valley of the Loire.</p>

<p>At the outset of my career in Paris I had been
confronted by a problem which demanded immediate
solution. I might lodge well and dress
poorly, or I might dress well and lodge poorly, but
I had not money enough to do both well. After
mature deliberation, I had chosen the latter course
and expended my money upon my wardrobe, reasoning
that all the world would notice my attire,
while no one would penetrate to my lodging. My
neighbors in the Rue Bailleul had not yet recovered
from the astonishment with which my advent had
filled them, and still gazed wonderingly and suspiciously
after me whenever I chanced to pass.</p>

<p>So I strode through the night away from that
shabby garret, and as I went I thought somewhat
bitterly of the high hopes I had brought with me to
the city a week before,&mdash;hopes of adventure and
glory, after the fashion, doubtless, of every youth
who came to Paris from the provinces. But a week
had passed without adventure, and as for glory,
it seemed farther away than ever. In faith, those
same hopes were about my only possession, a fact
brought painfully to my attention when I had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
opened my purse ten minutes since to pay my
score, and something must needs happen soon or&mdash;well,
I had seen a man taken from the Seine the
day before and his face seemed peaceful. At least,
I would never go back to the narrow life which I
had always hated.</p>

<p>A splash into a pool of mud brought me out of
my thoughts. I stopped and looked about me, but
did not recognize the street, which seemed a very
squalid one. The dilapidated wooden buildings
with their plastered fronts tottered together over
my head. A putrid stream filled the central gutter,
giving forth an odor which reminded me forcibly
of the court below my window. I started to retrace
my steps and return to a more inviting quarter
of the city, when a hand was laid suddenly upon
my shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, monsieur,&#8221; said a pleasant voice, &#8220;you
seem to have lost your way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis not a difficult task in Paris,&#8221; I replied,
and as I did so, threw off the man&#8217;s hand and
stepped quickly back to have my sword arm free in
case of need.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should be pleased to conduct monsieur
wherever he might wish to go,&#8221; continued the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
voice, the face of whose owner I tried in vain to
distinguish.</p>

<p>&#8220;A thousand thanks,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;If monsieur
will tell me the shortest way of reaching the
Rue St. Denis I need trouble him no further.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With pleasure. Take the first street to the
right, then onward three blocks, and monsieur is
there,&#8221; said my strange companion; and then as
I turned away, &#8220;There is one formality which
monsieur has overlooked.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what is that?&#8221; I questioned, sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Monsieur&#8217;s purse. No gentleman ever leaves
the presence of Cartouche with his purse in his
possession.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And is this Cartouche?&#8221; I asked, more to gain
time than for any other reason, for light as my
purse was, I could ill afford to part with it, even to
the most famous thief in Paris.</p>

<p>&#8220;Assuredly,&#8221; answered the fellow, and he held
out his hand with an air of nonchalance which exasperated
me. Cartouche&#8217;s fame had travelled far,
and he had spoken truth when he said that all men
with whom he talked left their purses with him,
yet I was in mood for an adventure, and reflected
that a man were better dead than penniless.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>&#8220;I fear that you will have to break your rule in
this instance, monsieur,&#8221; I said, after a moment&#8217;s
silence, during which his attitude had lost nothing
of its gay assurance. &#8220;The contents of my purse
are of infinitely greater value to me than they can
be to you. Hence I must beg leave to retain it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does monsieur count the cost?&#8221; he asked,
quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fully,&#8221; I answered, and, leaping back a pace,
drew my sword and stood on guard. At the same
instant he placed a whistle to his lips and blew one
shrill blast. I heard the sound of hastening footsteps,
and half a dozen blackguards, who had
doubtless been concealed near by, were upon me,
while Cartouche stood calmly to one side and
watched the conflict. The foremost ran on my
sword as upon a spit, and as he fell with a single,
sobbing cry, I stepped back against the wall, prepared
to give the others a warm argument. Yet
I knew I must be overpowered in the end by sheer
weight of numbers, and it was reputed that Cartouche
had only one penalty for resistance. For
some minutes I managed to keep the space in front
of me clear, running one of the scoundrels through
the shoulder before they saw they had a swordsman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
to deal with and retired to a safer distance. I
heard windows near by opening, and looked for assistance
from that direction, but in a moment they
were closed again. Evidently no one dared interfere
with Cartouche.</p>

<p>Then back at me his rascals came, all together,
and evidently counting on overwhelming me in the
rush, as, indeed, I thought they must do. Another
fellow felt the point of my sword in his thigh, but
matters were growing desperate, for I had myself
been stabbed in the arm and was fast becoming
winded. This was hotter work than I had ever
done.</p>

<p>&#8220;What have we here?&#8221; suddenly rang out a new
voice above the clash of swords. &#8220;An honest gentleman
beset by knaves? A moment, monsieur,
and I am with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>I discerned a dim figure running towards us, a
sword flashed in the air, and its owner was at my
side against the wall. He saw that I needed time
to breathe and made play in front of me, while I
stood with my mouth open, gasping like a fish.
But it was only for a moment, and I was back
in the fray again. That moment&#8217;s rest had given
me time to see that my companion was a master of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
fence, and when the need to shield me was past and
his blade was free to thrust, he ran one of the
thieves through the breast without more ado. This
reduced their number to three, and they gave back
a little, evidently appalled at our swordsmanship.</p>

<p>&#8220;A pistol-shot!&#8221; cried one of the rogues to
Cartouche. &#8220;A pistol-shot! &#8217;Twill settle the business
quickly.&#8221;</p>

<p>With an indescribable gesture Cartouche drew
his pistols from his belt.</p>

<p>&#8220;So let it be,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Your deaths on your
own heads, my braves,&#8221; and my heart stood still
as I heard him pull back the triggers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come!&#8221; I cried to my companion; &#8220;charge
him. We cannot remain here to be shot down like
dogs.&#8221;</p>

<p>He responded with a merry laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, this is better than the Com&eacute;die,&#8221; he said,
speaking for the first time since he had entered the
fray. &#8220;It thrills the nerves and makes the heart
beat high. But all things must end, and so, M.
Cartouche, I think it would be just as well to put
up your pistols and call your scoundrels off. You
will get no purses here this evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;De Richelieu!&#8221; cried Cartouche; and then in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
tone of deepest concern, &#8220;Believe me, M. le Duc,
I did not recognize you in the darkness, nor did I
know this gentleman to be a friend of yours, else
this would not have happened.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Enough, enough,&#8221; laughed my companion, as
Cartouche&#8217;s men slunk back into the gloom. &#8220;A
man could not recognize his mistress on a night
like this. My friend and I bid you adieu,&#8221; and
sheathing his sword and motioning me to follow,
he turned away without once looking back. I admit
that for my part I lacked his assurance, and
more than once glanced over my shoulder to make
certain that I was not about to receive a stab in the
back. But my fears were seemingly groundless,
for I saw no more of Cartouche or his men.</p>

<p>It was not until we reached a more frequented
street that I turned my thoughts to my companion.
I glanced at him with no little curiosity, for I knew
the young Duc de Richelieu by reputation, as,
indeed, did every other gentleman in the kingdom,
yes, and all the ladies, too. A grandnephew of the
Great Cardinal, he resembled in many ways that
intrepid and indomitable man. A fine swordsman,
gallant lover, and brave gentleman,&mdash;that is what
report said of him,&mdash;and I could wish no better epitaph<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
upon my gravestone, should I ever merit one.
I saw a straight, slight, handsome man of twenty-two
or three, with blue eyes and smiling lips. His
hat was worn well down over his forehead and his
cloak pulled negligently about his chin, as though
he knew the need of disguise and yet disdained to
use it, which in the end I found to be the case.
There was something strangely familiar in the face,
but I banished the thought in a moment, for I
knew very well that I had never before met the
Duc de Richelieu.</p>

<p>We walked for a time in silence, and as I glanced
at him again I recalled with amusement the story
of his <i>d&eacute;but</i> at Marly, seven or eight years before,
when Madame de Maintenon had pronounced him
&#8220;the dearest doll in the world.&#8221; He had found
favor with the ladies from the first, and, so the
story ran, had made such violent love to the Duchess
of Burgundy that he was dismissed from the
court and sent home under guard, together with a
lettre-de-cachet which had compelled his father to
take him to the Bastille, where he had been imprisoned
more than a year. The story had been repeated
in all four corners of the kingdom, and his
reputation was made from that moment. I could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
not but admit his comeliness, and of his courage I
had already sufficient proof. With this man for a
friend, I reflected, even a youth from the provinces
might go far. My arm was giving me some pain
where it had been wounded, but I managed to
bind my handkerchief about it under my cloak and
determined that it must wait a more convenient
season for attention. It was Richelieu who broke
the silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twas fortunate I had some business in this
quarter of the town to-night and chanced to pass
this way,&#8221; he said, with a light laugh. &#8220;Cartouche
is an old friend of mine. I did him a service
once,&mdash;saved him from the wheel, in fact,&mdash;and
since then he has been kind enough not to trouble
me or my friends; a forbearance which they greatly
value, and which may account, in part, for my
having so many. You perhaps heard him call my
name and so know who I am. May I ask whom
I had the honor of rescuing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In faith, it was no less than a rescue,&#8221; I answered,
warmly, &#8220;for the rogues had me all but
overcome. I am Jean de Brancas, at your service,
M. le Duc.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jean de Brancas?&#8221; and Richelieu glanced at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
me with a little air of surprise. &#8220;You are from
Poitiers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, from Poitiers,&#8221; I answered, looking at
him with astonishment. &#8220;But may I ask how you
know that, monsieur?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you are new to Paris, I suppose?&#8221; he
continued, smiling and disregarding my question.</p>

<p>&#8220;I came here but a week ago, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May I ask for what?&#8221; and he smiled yet more
broadly. &#8220;But I do not need to ask. It was for
adventure, was it not? So many youths come here
for that; and though most of them find adventures
in great number, they are seldom to their liking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is my case precisely, monsieur,&#8221; I said,
&#8220;with the exception of this evening, which is
greatly to my liking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps I may find you more of the same
kind,&#8221; and his face darkened grimly. &#8220;There are
many such, if one but knows where to look for
them. May I ask concerning your family, monsieur?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My father died a week before I started for
Paris,&#8221; I answered, simply. &#8220;My mother had preceded
him to the grave by two years. I had no
brothers nor sisters.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; he said, not unkindly, &#8220;and what heritage
did your father leave you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An honorable name, his sword and some skill
in wielding it, monsieur,&#8221; I answered, proudly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Heritage enough for any gentleman of spirit,&#8221;
cried the duke, heartily. &#8220;In truth, M. de Brancas,
I think we shall be friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My heritage is at your service, monsieur,&#8221; I
said. &#8220;I could ask no better employment for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis done,&#8221; and Richelieu laughed gayly.
&#8220;Here, strike hands upon it. Henceforth M. de
Brancas is the friend of Richelieu. He will use
his heritage in Richelieu&#8217;s service. And in return
Richelieu will see that M. de Brancas has many
chances to use this heritage and to make good returns
upon it. Is it agreed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With all my heart!&#8221; I cried, and we paused
to clasp hands, to the infinite astonishment of the
passers-by.</p>

<p>We had traversed a number of streets as we had
talked, whose names I did not know, but I saw that
we were entering a better quarter of the town. A
moment later, we came out in front of a long row
of stately buildings which I knew to be the Tuileries.
At one of the pavilions, which seemed more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
brilliantly lighted than the others, the duke entered,
and, as I hesitated, bade me enter with him.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no need to postpone your appearance
upon the future scene of your adventures,&#8221; he
said, as we crossed the wide vestibule, the lackeys
on either side bowing before him. &#8220;Besides, we
will tarry but a moment. We are both somewhat
travel-stained, &#8217;tis true, but that will count
rather in our favor than against us, for men of
action have come into fashion with the need for
them, and one good swordsman is valued more
highly than a dozen poets.&#8221;</p>

<p>My eyes caught the sumptuous details of the
place as we ascended the broad staircase, where
many people were hurrying up and down, all apparently
upon some business. But none of them
was too hurried to bow to my companion as to
a person of importance and to glance curiously
at me.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what is this place we are about to enter?&#8221;
I asked, as we paused at the stair-head.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the salon of Madame du Maine,&#8221; said
Richelieu, and in another moment we had entered
the brilliant room.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br />


<small>THE SALON OF MADAME DU MAINE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was with no little interest that I looked about
me, for the salon of the Duchess du Maine was one
of the most famous in France. My first impression
was one of disappointment, for the scene was less
striking than I had thought to find it. Groups of
people were scattered here and there down the long
room, and at the farther end a little court was
gathered about a lady whom I did not doubt was
the duchess herself. There were few other women
present, a circumstance which greatly astonished
me, and the men had a singular diversity of dress
and manner, betokening that it was no ordinary
motive which had drawn them together from so
many ranks of life and so many strata of society.
It needed but a glance to tell me that these were
not wits and beaux, but, in Richelieu&#8217;s words, men
of action. Nearly every one looked up as we
entered with, as it seemed to me, a vague air of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
fear, but this vanished instantly when they saw
that Richelieu was my companion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Mlle. de Launay,&#8221; said the duke to a
young lady who hastened to us from the nearest
group, &#8220;I trust fortune is using us as we could
wish?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, fortune is with us still, M. le Duc,&#8221; she
answered, smiling brightly. &#8220;Indeed, the justice
of our cause seems to have inspired an unaccustomed
constancy in that fickle dame, and she has
decided to stay with us to the end.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope it may be so.&#8221; And then, turning to
me, &#8220;Permit me to present my friend M. de Brancas,
a young man of stout heart who comes from
Poitiers to seek adventure in Paris, and who, I see,
has already fallen a victim to your bright eyes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In faith, &#8217;twould take a much stouter heart
than mine to resist them,&#8221; I protested, bowing
over the hand she gave me, &#8220;and I wager mine is
not the first they have made captive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but the fickleness of men!&#8221; exclaimed the
girl, smiling at me not unkindly. &#8220;To-day their
hearts are broken, to-morrow they are quite healed,
I know not by what wondrous surgery. I believed
that in the Chevalier de Rey I had at last found a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
constant man, but even he is failing me, for his
affection is decreasing regularly in a geometrical
ratio.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A geometrical ratio, mademoiselle?&#8221; cried
Richelieu. &#8220;And pray how do you show that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis very easily shown,&#8221; and her eyes were
sparkling with mischief. &#8220;You know it has been
the custom of M. de Rey to accompany me home
from the salon of Madame de Tencin on such occasions
as I have been there recently, and in the
course of the journey we are compelled to cross
the Place des Victoires. In the first stages of his
passion M. de Rey would walk me carefully around
the sides of this square in order to make the journey
longer, but as his affection gradually cooled he
took a more direct course, until, last night, he simply
traversed it in the middle. Hence I conclude
that his love has diminished in the same proportion
which exists between the diagonal of a square and
its sides.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quod erat demonstrandum!&#8221; cried Richelieu.
&#8220;I have never heard a geometrical proposition explained
more clearly. But come, I have a word
to say to madame and must introduce my <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i>
to her. You will excuse us, mademoiselle?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>I should not have been sorry to remain longer
where I was, but I promised myself to seek her
again before the evening closed. Richelieu was
kept busy bowing to right and left as we traversed
the length of the room, but he did not pause,
though obviously many would have been grateful
for a second&#8217;s conversation with him. In a moment
we reached the group at the farther end,
which separated as we approached and opened a
way to the duchess.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Richelieu!&#8221; she cried, as soon as she perceived
him; and holding out her hands to him, &#8220;I
am glad to see you, and hope you bring good news.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I trust you will think it such, madame,&#8221; replied
Richelieu, and he bent over her hand and kissed it.</p>

<p>A curious gleam illumined the gaze she bent
upon him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have, then, decided?&#8221; she asked, in a
voice which she endeavored vainly to compose.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am at madame&#8217;s service now and always,&#8221;
and he bowed again with a certain sternness in his
face and without raising his eyes.</p>

<p>The duchess went red, then white, and her eyes
were like twin stars. I dimly realized that she had
won a great victory. An excited whispering behind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
me told me that others had understood better
than I.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thank you, M. le Duc,&#8221; she said, when her
emotion permitted her to speak. &#8220;Believe me,
your devotion shall not be forgotten.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I have forgotten something, madame,&#8221;
cried Richelieu, gayly, as though putting the subject
behind him. &#8220;This is my friend M. de Brancas,
who has offered his sword in my service.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And in madame&#8217;s, should she ever have need
of so feeble an instrument,&#8221; I added. I felt rather
than saw the questioning glance she shot at Richelieu
over my bowed head and the affirmative nod
he gave in reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;M. de Brancas is welcome,&#8221; she answered,
graciously, &#8220;and his generous offer shall be remembered.
But you must excuse me, gentlemen,&#8221;
she continued, turning to the group, which had
withdrawn to a little distance, but which yet could
hear every word that passed. &#8220;I have much to do
and must leave you. M. Chancel, will you kindly
tell Mlle. de Launay that I wish her to join me in
the course of half an hour?&#8221;</p>

<p>I gazed with unfeigned interest after this remarkable
woman as she walked away, for that remarkable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
she was I very well knew. A granddaughter
of the Great Cond&eacute;, she had been compelled
by Louis XIV. to marry the Duke du Maine,
his eldest son by Madame de Montespan, an alliance
which the house of Cond&eacute; had regarded as a
disgrace, but which it was powerless to prevent.
This disgrace had been somewhat mitigated in
1714, when the king had issued a decree legitimating
the duke and declaring him competent to
succeed to the throne in the failure of the legitimate
line, a decree which had awakened lively dissatisfaction
among the other noble houses, who
were jealous of their precedence, and which had
been the subject of no little comment even at Poitiers.
Madame du Maine had at once taken a position
commensurate with this new honor, and her
salons at Sceaux and at the Tuileries were known
by reputation from the Pyrenees to the Meuse.</p>

<p>I had seen at a glance that she was not beautiful.
Her figure was almost infantile in its proportions,
and a slightly deformed shoulder destroyed its
symmetry. Her mouth was large and her other
features irregular, but this was more than counter-balanced
by the beauty and brilliancy of her eyes.
I, who had seen them blaze under the magic of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
Richelieu&#8217;s words, would certainly never forget
them. It was Richelieu&#8217;s voice which aroused me
from my thoughts.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see the people interest you, de Brancas,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;and well they may, for it is seldom indeed
that one room contains so many worth attention.
That gentleman whom the duchess has just sent
on an errand to Mlle. de Launay is Lagrange
Chancel, whose philippics have driven so many
thorns into the side of the regent. For myself, I
confess I deem the sword a better weapon of warfare
than the pen, but each has its uses. That man
over there in black and with the air of a bourgeois
is de Mesmes, president of parliament, through
whom we hope to be able to do great things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Great things?&#8221; I asked. &#8220;I do not understand,
monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will in time,&#8221; he answered, smiling.
&#8220;Till then have patience. Yonder handsome
churchman is the Cardinal de Polignac, who affects
to be absorbed in a new Latin poem, but who is
really interested only in politics, and in whom I
have little faith. There is Malesieu, madame&#8217;s
tutor, who was wont to bore us nearly to death
reading the tragedies of Sophocles when the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
Honey Bees met at Sceaux. There is the Abb&eacute;
Chaulieu, whose age cannot dim the brightness of
his wit nor lessen the lightness of his heart. And
there is Saint Aulaire, whose eighty years do not
prevent him entertaining a hopeless passion for the
duchess, but who knows nothing of politics and
cares less, and who, consequently, is no longer in
favor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, monsieur,&#8221; I protested, &#8220;even I can see
that this is no ordinary salon. These are not wits
nor poets. They are not disputing. They are not
even gossiping. They are talking in undertones.
They have an air of I know not what,&mdash;of plotting,
of intrigue,&mdash;some of them even of fear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have come dangerously near the truth,
my friend,&#8221; and Richelieu glanced about to see
that no one heard. &#8220;They do intrigue, they are
plotting, and some of them do fear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what are they plotting? Whom do they
fear?&#8221; I questioned, determined to get to the bottom
of this riddle if I could.</p>

<p>Again Richelieu glanced about him, and at that
moment Polignac touched him on the arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;May I have a word with you, M. le Duc?&#8221; he
asked.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; answered Richelieu, though I saw
he was not pleased at the interruption. &#8220;Excuse
me a moment, de Brancas,&#8221; and the two stepped to
one side, engaged in earnest conversation. I
glanced about me, and seeing that Mlle. de Launay
was making her adieux preparatory to joining
her mistress, hastened to her side.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are already famous, M. de Brancas,&#8221; she
cried, as I approached her. &#8220;Richelieu has dropped
a word of it. Believe me, it is not every one who
cares to cross swords with the rogues of Cartouche,
or who values his purse more highly than his head.
Perhaps you had some keepsake in yours, monsieur,
which made it doubly precious,&#8221; she added,
mischievously.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, mademoiselle,&#8221; I answered; &#8220;and yet, I
was loath to part with it, else I should have had no
proper receptacle in which to place that ribbon
which you wear in your hair and which you are
going to give me presently.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, am I?&#8221; she exclaimed, as her hand mechanically
sought her hair and she looked into my
eyes. &#8220;Well, take it,&#8221; and she handed me the
ribbon. &#8220;Such audacity deserves reward. No<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
one would for a moment suspect you were from the
provinces, M. de Brancas,&#8221; she added.</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, mademoiselle, I forget it myself when
you are speaking,&#8221; I answered, and she laughed
merrily and bade me adieu, while I placed the ribbon
in my purse, simulating a passion which I confess
I did not feel.</p>

<p>But I watched her pass across the room as I had
watched the duchess, for both were unusual
women, and the maid&#8217;s fame was, if anything,
greater than that of the mistress. Mlle. de Launay
possessed little beauty, as I had seen for myself,
and she was of obscure birth, the daughter of
a painter, it was said, of whom no one had ever
heard. But the abbess of a convent in Normandy
had discovered the child somewhere&mdash;beside her
drunken father in a bottle-house, most likely&mdash;and
had taken a liking to her and given her a refuge
in the convent. She had received a brilliant education,
and oddly enough, had preferred the exact
sciences to belles-lettres. Of her predilection for
geometry I had already had proof. But the abbess
died and she had been forced to leave the convent.
Through the influence of friends she had
secured the position of femme du chambre to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
Madame du Maine, which she had been compelled
to accept to keep from starving, and it was from
that position that she had risen, by sheer force of
character, to be one of the brightest lights of the
gay court at Sceaux. Every girl in the kingdom
knew the story and had resolved to profit by it,
but few had the wit to do so. It was again Richelieu
who broke in upon my thoughts.</p>

<p>&#8220;A remarkable woman, is she not, monsieur?&#8221;
he asked, following my eyes. &#8220;Few have yet
measured the height of her talents, and no one
has sounded the depth of her heart. But come,
let us go. You are to lodge with me to-night, for
I have many things to say to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing would please me more, M. le Duc,&#8221;
I answered, warmly, thankful for any chance
which postponed my return to the Rue Bailleul and
delighted at the prospect of entering the Hotel de
Richelieu. He led the way towards the door, and
as he repassed the people scattered about the room
I remarked a new expression on their faces. They
turned to look at him as they had done before, and
not one failed to return his bow, but their manner
was not the same. It seemed to combine respect
and contempt, admiration and disapproval. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
duke appeared not to notice it, yet he avoided any
pretext for stopping, as though he did not wish to
enter into a conversation which might easily become
disagreeable. It was evident to me, however,
that the hidden meaning of the words which he
had exchanged with the duchess was known to all
the persons in the room, and that they knew not
whether to blame or praise. I, also, was to learn
their meaning before the night was out.</p>

<p>We paused in the vestibule, Richelieu wrapping
his cloak about his face and pulling his hat
down over his eyes. He bade me do the same,
and in another moment we were in the street. We
mingled quickly with the crowd which, even in
winter, thronged the gardens of the Tuileries, and
turning towards the river, crossed it by the Pont
Royal.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br />


<small>A LITTLE LESSON IN POLITICS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Duc de Richelieu at that time occupied a
magnificent hotel in the Rue des Saints P&egrave;res.
The house, which had been pointed out to me as
one of the sights of Paris, was in the form of a
hollow square,&mdash;a form which had become very
popular for buildings of this kind,&mdash;the open side
of the square fronting the street and being closed
by a high wall. Just back of the Hotel de Richelieu,
on the Quai Malaquest, stood the famous
Hotel de Bouillon, and next to it the equally
famous Hotel de la Roche Sur Yon, the three together
forming one of the most imposing and interesting
quarters of the city, and one which I had had
little hope of inspecting except from the outside.</p>

<p>Richelieu led the way along the quay at a rapid
pace, seemingly absorbed in thought. I, also, had
much to occupy my mind. There were two questions
which vexed me and to which I could find no
answer. How did Richelieu know I was from Poitiers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
and what was the purpose of that curious
assembly in the salon of Madame du Maine? I
was still pondering on these, when we turned into
the Rue des Saints P&egrave;res and stopped before a wall
in which was a small postern.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will enter here,&#8221; said Richelieu, and he
took a key from his belt and opened the gate. We
passed through, and he locked the gate carefully
behind him.</p>

<p>The garden in which we found ourselves, and
which I saw to be the great central court, was dark,
and only a suspicion of light glimmered here and
there through the closed shutters of the house.
Richelieu led the way to a door in the west wing,
which he opened as he had the gate, and also locked
after we had entered. Then with a gesture commanding
caution he passed along a hall and up a
narrow stair, unlocked another door, and ushered
me into a room where a candle was burning dimly
on a table. By its light I could see that the room
was of some size and richly furnished, and through
an open doorway I caught a faint glimpse of other
apartments beyond.</p>

<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; exclaimed Richelieu, with a sigh of
relief, &#8220;we are safe,&#8221; and he flung his cloak and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
hat into a corner and dropped into a chair, motioning
me to do likewise. &#8220;As you doubtless know,
it is sometimes desirable to be thought at home
when one is really abroad, and that was the case
this evening. No one saw me leave, no one saw
me enter, hence I was here all the while and could
have had no hand in whatever has happened in
the mean time. But, man, are you wounded?&#8221;
he asked, suddenly, observing, as I removed my
cloak, the blood-stained handkerchief about my
arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only a scratch, monsieur,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;A
little water and a clean rag will repair the damage.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was on his feet in an instant, and in a few
minutes the wound was washed and bound up, so
that it gave me no further concern, and, indeed,
need not again be mentioned.</p>

<p>&#8220;There will soon be need of long swords and
strong arms such as yours,&#8221; observed the duke,
settling down again into his chair. &#8220;Here, drink
this,&#8221; and as he spoke he poured out a glass of
wine from a bottle which stood on the table at his
elbow. &#8220;&#8217;Twill do you good. I would not have
anything happen to impair that arm of yours, for,
as I saw to-night, it knows how to wield a sword<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
to some purpose. How time passes!&#8221; and he looked
at me with an expression of kindly interest. &#8220;It
seems hardly possible that you can be little Jean de
Brancas, of Poitiers.&#8221;</p>

<p>He smiled as he saw my eyes widen in questioning
amazement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes, I had forgotten,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You do
not yet know how I guessed you were from Poitiers.
I will tell you a little story which may explain
it. Some six or seven years ago there was a
boy who was in disgrace.&#8221; He paused a moment
and smiled to himself, as at the memory of some
boyish prank. &#8220;So it was decided that he should
be sent to the Ch&acirc;teau d&#8217;Oleron for a time, to get
the sea air and incidentally to think over his sins.
He set out from Paris in a great coach, with no
companion but his tutor. In order that there might
be no scandal the trip was to be made incognito.
They had horrible weather, the rain falling incessantly,
and by the time they reached Poitiers the
Clain was swollen to a torrent. They were told
that the river could still be forded a mile below the
town, so they drove to the place pointed out to
them and the coachman whipped the horses into
the water. In a moment, as it seemed to the boy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
within, the horses were beyond their depth and the
coach was lifted from the bottom and swept off
down the stream. It seems that they had attempted
to ford in the wrong place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; I murmured, &#8220;I begin to understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me finish my story,&#8221; and Richelieu stood
beside me and placed his hand upon my shoulder.
&#8220;The driver was so terrified that he dropped the
reins. The tutor seemed paralyzed with fright.
The boy was struggling vainly to open the door
and get out of the carriage, when he heard a cry of
encouragement, and looking through the window,
he saw another boy, two or three years younger
than himself. This boy was on a horse, which he
was forcing through the water. In a moment he
was at the head of one of the coach horses; he
caught its bridle, and turning his own horse across
the stream, compelled the others to follow. Almost
before those within realized his purpose the horses
reached firm ground and pulled the coach out after
them upon the other bank.&#8221;</p>

<p>I would have spoken, but Richelieu silenced me
with a gesture.</p>

<p>&#8220;The boy in the carriage opened the door and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
leaped out,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;He ran to the other
boy and caught his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8217;Twas bravely done!&#8217; he cried. &#8216;I know no
one else who would have dared it.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the boy on horseback merely smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;It was a little thing to do,&#8217; he said, and the
other boy noticed that he was plainly dressed.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;But you shall be rewarded,&#8217; and he pulled his
purse from his pocket.</p>

<p>&#8220;The boy on horseback grew very red and drew
himself up proudly.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;You mistake me, monsieur,&#8217; he said. &#8216;I do
not want your money.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The other boy grew red also at that and put
back his purse.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;At least tell me your name,&#8217; he asked. &#8216;I
shall never forget your name.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the boy on horseback smiled again.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;My name is Jean de Brancas,&#8217; he said, and the
other boy could see that he was proud of the name.
And just then his tutor came and separated them,
but as the coach drove away he leaned far out of
the window and waved his hand to the other boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Good-by, Jean!&#8217; he cried. &#8216;We shall meet
again some day, and then it will be my turn.&#8217;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>Richelieu paused for a moment, and I felt that
my eyes were wet.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you see,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;I had reason to be
pleased this evening when I heard that it was Jean
de Brancas to whom I had been of service, and
whom I intend to keep by my side. For I was
the boy in the coach, and I remember that ride
through the river as though it had happened yesterday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I also remember it, M. le Duc,&#8221; I said,
&#8220;and the boy who sprang from the coach and who
thanked me so prettily has been my beau ideal from
then until this day. I questioned many people, but
no one knew him. I have dreamed of him many
times, and in my dreams it was always I who was
at his right hand, aiding him to win a thousand
battles, even as you aided me to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that is where I would have you,&#8221; cried
Richelieu, &#8220;and where you shall be henceforth.&#8221;</p>

<p>We were both more moved than we cared to
show, for the memory of that boyish exploit was
sweet to both of us, and a little silence followed.
It was Richelieu who broke it.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are many things afoot in Paris,&#8221; he said,
in a graver tone, and looking at me keenly. &#8220;But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
before I go further tell me, are you for the regent
or against him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am neither for nor against the regent,&#8221; I
answered, promptly. &#8220;I am for the king.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A wise answer,&#8221; and Richelieu smiled. &#8220;One
that commits you to nothing. But come, you may
be frank with me. What do you think of the Duke
of Orleans?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Duke of Orleans is quite indifferent to
me,&#8221; I answered, readily enough. &#8220;I have heard
little about him, and none of that was to his credit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well spoken!&#8221; cried Richelieu, heartily. &#8220;I
see you will be with us. Come, I will trust you
with a secret, but first permit me to give you a little
lesson in politics. You say you know little about
the regent. Let me tell you something about him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now, I was not quite so ignorant of passing
events as Richelieu seemed to think, yet I deemed it
wise to keep my council and to hear these things
as for the first time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Philip, Duke of Orleans,&#8221; continued Richelieu,
&#8220;is not rightfully regent of France. Louis the
Great&#8217;s will provided explicitly that there should
be a council of regency during the king&#8217;s minority,
in which Orleans should have only one vote. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
real power was given to Louis&#8217;s son, the Duke du
Maine, but he stood idly by and permitted Orleans
to take up the regency almost unchallenged.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The more fool he,&#8221; I ejaculated, involuntarily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right. The more fool he. But it is not for
him we are going to fight. At least, not directly.
He is busy making a collection of snuffboxes at
Sceaux, and does not even know there is anything
afoot. It is for the Duchess du Maine. Ah, there
is a woman! Not beautiful, perhaps, but charming,
and what a spirit! Orleans has not only assumed
the regency, he has also deprived the Duke
du Maine of his right to succeed to the throne.
Again you say, that is his affair. True, but let us
not forget the duchess. Do you know what she
did when she heard of that decree? She was compelled
to give up one of her apartments in the
Tuileries in consequence, but before leaving she
smashed every article of furniture in the room, and
had to be carried away like a wounded general
from a battle-field where he had won a great victory.
Mlle. de Launay told me it was magnificent.
In addition to all this, most of us have some
little private quarrel to settle with the regent, and
will welcome this opportunity to abase him. Well,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
what we propose to do is to take the regency
away from Philip of Orleans and to give it to
Philip of Spain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Philip of Spain!&#8221; I cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Philip of Spain. Who has a better right?
He is the king&#8217;s uncle, the next in succession to the
throne. And what is Orleans? He allows Dubois
to manage the state while he spends his time with
his mistresses at the back of the Louvre, there,&#8221;
and Richelieu paused from sheer lack of breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;That may be,&#8221; I managed to say, &#8220;but what
chance of success can there be?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Every chance,&#8221; cried the duke, rising from his
chair and pacing excitedly up and down the room.
&#8220;All Brittany is with us, and will rise to our support
so soon as we choose to give the word. Half
the nobility of the kingdom, whom Orleans has
neglected no opportunity to insult, is with us. Alberoni,
Philip&#8217;s prime minister, has collected
troops. They will soon be at the frontier ready to
invade France and depose the monstrous thing that
governs it. Cellamare, Spain&#8217;s ambassador at Versailles,
has all the threads in his fingers and is
almost ready to strike. The train is laid and all
that awaits is to apply the match. That will soon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
be done, and you will see Orleans tottering from
the throne.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But does he not suspect?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, that is the only thing,&#8221; and the light suddenly
left Richelieu&#8217;s face. &#8220;Sometimes I think
he does, sometimes I believe he does not. It is not
Orleans himself I fear. He pays little heed to what
is going on. But Dubois and H&eacute;rault,&mdash;that is
another story. They have the police well organized.
There are spies everywhere, and once or
twice recently I have fancied I was followed, but
that may have been for another reason. Indeed,
the regent has no cause to love me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what is your part in this conspiracy, monsieur?&#8221;
I questioned, for I felt that there was still
something left untold.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, my part,&#8221; said Richelieu, his brow clouding
still more. &#8220;Well, I will tell you, as I this
evening told Madame du Maine. My part is to see
that my regiment does not resist the Spanish army,
but surrenders and opens to it the gates of Bayonne,
the city where it is stationed, just at the foot
of the Pyrenees.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But that is treason!&#8221; I cried, astounded at this
disclosure.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>&#8220;Treason to the regent, perhaps,&#8221; answered the
duke, calmly, &#8220;but not to the king.&#8221;</p>

<p>So this was the victory the duchess had won!
Well, she had reason to be proud of it. And as I
sat, too bewildered to say more, there came a tap at
the door, and Richelieu arose and opened it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Jacques,&#8221; he said, to the man who stood
bowing on the threshold, and who permitted none
of his astonishment at seeing me to appear in his
face, &#8220;what is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A note, M. le Duc, delivered but a moment
ago,&#8221; and he held out a tiny missive. Richelieu
seized it, eagerly scanned the address, and tore it
open with a hand trembling with excitement. He
read its contents at a glance, and his eyes were
dancing with joy as he raised them to mine.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may go, Jacques,&#8221; he said to the lacquey;
&#8220;I shall not forget your promptness;&#8221; and then
turning to me as the door closed, &#8220;Do you know
what this means, de Brancas? It means success
in another affair dearer to my heart than this conspiracy
of Cellamare. Ah, the work that I have
done to secure this one little note,&mdash;the servants I
have bribed, the women I have cajoled, the disguises
I have assumed! And here at last is victory,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
for this says, &#8216;Be at the dryad fountain in the
Palais Royal gardens at ten o&#8217;clock to-morrow
night.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A rendezvous?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, a rendezvous. But you could not guess
with whom were you to guess forever. Who do
you think will be at the dryad fountain waiting for
me at ten o&#8217;clock to-morrow evening? Who but
Charlotte d&#8217;Orleans, Mlle. de Valois!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mlle. de Valois!&#8221; I gasped. &#8220;The daughter
of the regent! Why, man, you must be mad,&#8221;
and I gazed in astonishment at this youth of
twenty-two who while plotting against the father
dared make love to the daughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you but saw her, de Brancas,&#8221; cried the
duke, &#8220;you would say I was far from mad. I
fell in love with her the first time her eyes met
mine. That was at a ball given a month ago for
the Duchess de Lorraine, when the regent was celebrating
her visit to Paris. You have never seen
such eyes, de Brancas. We rave over Madame du
Maine&#8217;s eyes,&mdash;you have seen them and know how
wonderful they are,&mdash;but they fade as the stars
fade at sunrise when Charlotte d&#8217;Orleans appears.
No, &#8217;tis not a lover&#8217;s rhapsody,&#8221; he added, seeing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
me smile; &#8220;there are none in the kingdom to
compare with them. Were this not so I should
not so readily have fallen victim, for I have gazed
into many and many without a quickening of the
pulse.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stopped to read through the note again, and
as he folded it and placed it tenderly in his pocket
I saw he was in earnest. Indeed, the eyes must
needs be beautiful which could so move the heart
of this seasoned courtier.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the regent,&#8221; I said, at last, &#8220;the regent.
What thinks he of all this? I had not thought him
a friend of yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A friend of mine!&#8221; cried Richelieu. &#8220;De
Brancas, if there is one person in Paris whom he
detests above all others, it is myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But then,&#8221; I began, and stopped. I had no
wish to seem too curious.</p>

<p>&#8220;But then,&#8221; said Richelieu, pausing in his walk
up and down the room. &#8220;Go on, de Brancas.
What would you say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then he does not know?&#8221; I asked. &#8220;You
have met with obstacles?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Obstacles!&#8221; and Richelieu smiled at me with
triumphant face. &#8220;Yes,&mdash;such as most men would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
falter at. Imagine wooing a woman with whom
you can never speak,&mdash;who is kept from you as
from the plague! Ah, there was a problem, and
one of the sort I love to solve. Why, de Brancas,
if her father suspected that I had in my pocket a
note from his daughter, he would have me back in
a trice in my old cell at the Bastille.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused a moment and touched the note with
trembling fingers.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I could never exchange a word with her,&#8221;
he went on, at last, &#8220;but I made progress, nevertheless.
Gold will work many miracles. Every
morning she found a note in a bouquet of flowers,&mdash;on
her writing-desk, on her dressing-table, on
her embroidery-frame. Ah, how I cudgelled my
poor brain in writing those notes, pleading, passionate,
despairing by turns! At every ball, every
concert, every f&ecirc;te where she was like to be, there
was I, and if I could not use my lips, at least I
could use my eyes. She looked at me first indifferently,
then curiously, then shyly,&mdash;and last night at
the Op&eacute;ra she blushed when her eyes met mine,
and I knew the battle won. To-morrow night I
can speak to her. Ah, how I shall make her love
me!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>Well, he was worth loving. My eyes blur with
tears even yet as I see him again standing there, so
glad, so straight, so gallant, and think of what
came after. If I were a woman, I know I should
have loved him heart and soul. Even as a man,
&#8217;tis little less than that.</p>

<p>&#8220;In affairs of the heart, as in affairs of state, my
sword is at the service of M. le Duc,&#8221; I said, no
little moved, and again we struck hands upon our
compact, in which, I could not but think, it was I
who must reap the most advantage. For of what
service could the sword of an unknown youth of
twenty be to Richelieu? And yet, as I was soon to
learn, even a humble sword when backed by a
loyal heart may be of service to the greatest.</p>

<p>Jacques was called and told to show me my
apartment. What a contrast it was to that den
under the gutters in the Rue Bailleul! Richelieu
declared he would not part with me, and with some
reluctance I gave Jacques the address of my former
lodging, that he might bring away my wardrobe.
That done, I was soon abed, turned to the wall, and
slept a sleep infinitely sweetened by this sudden
change in my circumstances.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br />


<small>A DUEL AT MID-DAY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">I awoke</span> betimes the next morning, but did not
immediately arise. In fact, I welcomed the opportunity
to thoroughly review my position and decide
how best to steer my course. Here, then, was I,
Jean de Brancas, poor in everything but spirit,
who, the day before, had been tramping the streets
of Paris friendless and well-nigh penniless, and
who had even thought of the Seine as a last place
of refuge. Since then, by the merest good fortune,
which I had done little to merit, I had gained the
friendship of Richelieu, the man in all the kingdom
whom I most admired. I had been given entrance,
if not to the society of Sceaux, at least to the Paris
salon of Madame du Maine. I had met Mlle. de
Launay, copies of whose witty letters had found
their way even to Poitiers, where I had read them
until I knew them by rote. I had been admitted
to the secret of the Cellamare conspiracy, and this,
I confess, rather stuck in my throat. Open combat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
and the bright flash of swords I would have welcomed
gladly, but I had small relish for intrigue
and conspiracy and the considerations which sometimes
make it necessary to stab in the dark. And,
in truth, I had little hope that the conspiracy would
succeed, for it seemed founded on selfishness, and
the French nation would forget its hostility to the
regent once a Spanish army was on its soil. Yet
it mattered not to me who was regent, Philip
of Orleans or Philip of Spain, and I reflected that
even if Richelieu fell, he would not fall far. He
had shown me kindness and good will, and these
I was determined to repay as best I could. At
worst, I could lose nothing but my life, and the
prize was worth the risk.</p>

<p>It was late when I arose, but Richelieu had not
yet appeared, and I descended into the court, attracted
by the busy life which I saw there. An
army of servants was running hither and thither,
grooming and exercising horses, cleaning harness,
polishing the gilding on half a dozen coaches,
sprinkling clean, white sand along the walks,
sweeping and dusting the wide entrance, and doing
a hundred other things which attested the care and
attention given to every detail of the management<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
of this great house. At one side of the court I was
surprised to see standing a coach to which two
horses were harnessed. The driver was on the
box, and the equipage was apparently ready to take
the road at a moment&#8217;s notice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does M. le Duc go abroad this morning?&#8221; I
asked of a man who was standing near.</p>

<p>&#8220;I really do not know, monsieur,&#8221; he answered,
politely.</p>

<p>&#8220;For whom, then, is the coach waiting?&#8221; and I
indicated it with a gesture.</p>

<p>He glanced at me in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Monsieur must be new to the hotel,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Whenever M. le Duc is at home a carriage is kept
waiting in the court, in case he might have use for
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>I turned away with a new understanding of the
character and resources of the remarkable man
whose guest I was, and returned slowly to the great
reception-hall, where Jacques was awaiting me.
Richelieu himself appeared soon after, and I was
relieved to find that his manner preserved the
hearty cordiality of the night before. I had been
half afraid&mdash;though I would not admit it even to
myself&mdash;that the morning might in some way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
bring disillusion with it and send toppling the
pretty castles which I had been building in the air.
Breakfast was soon served. We lingered over the
meal, during which I gave the duke a little history
of my family, and noon was striking as we left the
house.</p>

<p>&#8220;We go to the Caf&eacute; Procope,&#8221; said Richelieu.
&#8220;It is in a new style which is becoming very popular,
and I fancy we shall find some one there who
can tell us the news of the court.&#8221;</p>

<p>We entered the carriage which was in waiting,
drove out through the central gate, the army of
lacqueys bowing on either side, and across Paris
towards the Rue Saint Germain-des-Pres, where
the caf&eacute; stood, and which it bade fair to render
one of the most fashionable quarters of the city.
The caf&eacute; had, as the duke said, inaugurated a new
style, and there was only one other in Paris at the
time, the Caf&eacute; de la Regence, whose name was
sufficient of itself to keep my companion away
from it.</p>

<p>A drive of ten minutes brought us to the suburb
where the caf&eacute; stood, and the throng of carriages
before the door told of the crowd within. A perfect
babel greeted us as we entered, for it had become<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
the fashion for each person to do his best to
out-talk his neighbors. We found with some difficulty
an unoccupied table, and Richelieu motioned
me to a seat while he took the one opposite.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no coffee made in Paris which compares
with that served here,&#8221; he remarked, and as
he summoned a waiter I looked about me. The
room was large, and was rendered even larger in
appearance by the numerous richly-carved mirrors
which embellished the walls. Through an open
doorway at the back came the click of dice and
much loud laughter. Gayly attired parties were
continually entering and leaving the private cabinets,
and trills of feminine laughter mingled with
the harsher voices of the men.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, de Rey,&#8221; cried Richelieu at that moment
to a gentleman sitting at the next table, &#8220;Mlle.
de Launay was telling us a clever story at your
expense last night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what was it, may I ask?&#8221; questioned de
Rey, a tall, black-moustachioed man, whom I
thought ungainly.</p>

<p>&#8220;She accuses you of fickleness in your love-affairs,&#8221;
replied the duke, and he related the geometrical
sally.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>&#8220;What would you have, monsieur?&#8221; cried de
Rey, as the story was finished, laughing as heartily
as any one. &#8220;A man never knows to-day
whom he will meet to-morrow, and not knowing
that, how can he be certain whom he will
love?&#8221;</p>

<p>While he was speaking three men had entered
and taken seats at a neighboring table. They commenced
conversing in voices which seemed to me
unnecessarily loud, and I could not avoid overhearing
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you heard,&#8221; one of them asked, &#8220;of the
disposition the regent is to make of his daughter,
Mlle. de Valois?&#8221;</p>

<p>I glanced at Richelieu and saw that he also had
heard. His face was white with anger, and I saw
he knew the men and did not doubt that they had
come there purposely to insult him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Proposals for her hand have been received
from the King of Sardinia,&#8221; continued the speaker,
&#8220;and the regent is only too glad to get rid of
the fair Charlotte. She seems destined to become
even more troublesome than Madame du Berri,&#8221;
and the speaker laughed, with an insolent note
in his voice, and glanced meaningly in our direction.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
A sudden stillness had fallen upon the
crowd.</p>

<p>&#8220;By my word,&#8221; cried the other, looking full at
Richelieu, &#8220;&#8217;twill be bad news to a certain gentleman
whose name begins with R, and who, I have
heard, has been dying of love for the Valois this
month past.&#8221;</p>

<p>The duke was out of his chair in an instant, but
I was before him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Monsieur will doubtless give me the pleasure
of a moment&#8217;s conversation outside?&#8221; I inquired,
courteously.</p>

<p>&#8220;And who the devil may you be?&#8221; he asked, in
an insolent tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps this will tell you,&#8221; I cried, red with
anger at the insult, and I struck him fairly in the
mouth with my open hand.</p>

<p>He leaped from his chair and drew his sword
with a furious gesture, nor did mine linger in its
sheath. Tables were overturned, chairs were
thrown aside, and our swords had already engaged,
when a little fat man, with prodigiously long
moustachios, came running up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not in here, messieurs! Not in here, I beg of
you!&#8221; he cried, wringing his hands. &#8220;It would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
ruin my business should those devils of H&eacute;rault
ever hear of it.&#8221; I remembered that H&eacute;rault was
lieutenant of police.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is right,&#8221; I said, dropping my point. &#8220;Let
us adjourn to the street, monsieur. There, at least,
we shall injure no one but ourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>We had already commenced the combat, and I
admit that I took my chance in lowering my guard,
but I was not prepared for the act of cowardice
which followed. For before I could recover myself
I felt rather than saw my antagonist thrust at
me, and I involuntarily closed my eyes as I waited
to feel his sword in my flesh. But at that instant
there came a ringing clash of steel on steel, and I
opened my eyes to see the scoundrel&#8217;s weapon flying
over the heads of the spectators.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, de Gare,&#8221; cried Richelieu, for it was he
who had disarmed him, &#8220;and yet you dare associate
with gentlemen! If I gave you your deserts
I would run you through where you stand. But I
prefer killing you with your sword in your hand,
so follow me to the street and we will finish this
argument. Stand back, de Brancas,&#8221; he continued
to me, as I attempted to interfere. &#8220;This is my
quarrel. It was I whom they insulted.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>The Comte de Gare, foaming with rage, picked
up his sword and followed to the street. The sentiment
of the crowd was plainly with Richelieu,
and a moment later when I looked about for de
Gare&#8217;s companions they had disappeared. A ring
of curious spectators formed around the two men,
and their swords were ringing together in an instant.
Before a moment passed I saw that de Gare
had found his master. He realized it, too, and his
face went from red to white as he felt the duke&#8217;s
iron wrist and saw the implacable purpose in his
eyes. Plainly it was only the question of a few
moments. The duke was playing with him, parrying
almost carelessly his savage thrusts, and advancing
his own point nearer and nearer to his
heart. The onlookers waited with bated breath for
the thrust which they knew would be fatal.</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall see, gentlemen,&#8221; cried Richelieu,
gayly, for his self-possession had returned the instant
he felt his adversary&#8217;s sword against his own,
&#8220;the proper way to deal with cowards. This fellow
has presumed to be seen in the company of
gentlemen, and I am glad that it was reserved for
my sword to punish him. Ah, you break!&#8221; he
cried again, for the other had given back a step.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
I, who was standing at the duke&#8217;s side, saw a kind
of ferocity spring to life in de Gare&#8217;s eyes, and I
noticed that his left hand was no longer behind
him, but was concealed in the folds of his doublet.
Something, I know not what, made me suspect the
man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be on guard, monsieur!&#8221; I cried to Richelieu,
&#8220;he means some treachery,&#8221; and even as I spoke
he drew forth his hand and threw a poniard full at
Richelieu&#8217;s heart. At the same instant, comprehending
de Gare&#8217;s purpose, I pushed Richelieu to
one side. I felt a sharp, hot pain in my right shoulder,
and knew that the dagger had wounded me.
With a terrible cry Richelieu sprang forward, and
fairly beating down his guard, plunged his sword
to the hilt in his breast. De Gare made a desperate
effort to keep his feet, grasped the sword, drew it
from the wound, and fell to the street, the blood
gushing forth in a torrent. He breathed convulsively
once or twice, with the crowd looking down
upon him, his eyes glazed, a shudder ran through
his body, and he was dead.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thus perish all cowards,&#8221; said Richelieu. And
then, turning to me, &#8220;You saved my life, de Brancas.
&#8217;Twas a brave act.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>&#8220;No more than you have twice done for me,
monsieur,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;I have only half paid
my debt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you are wounded!&#8221; he cried, seeing that
I held my handkerchief to my shoulder and that it
was red with blood. &#8220;The dagger struck you,
then? Let me see how serious it is,&#8221; and he was
tearing the doublet away from my shoulder ere I
had time to protest.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis only a flesh wound, monsieur,&#8221; I said.
&#8220;Pray do not trouble about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Trouble about it, indeed. Come in here with
me,&#8221; and he dragged rather than led me into the
caf&eacute; again. &#8220;Come, Maitre Delorme,&#8221; he cried
to the proprietor, who was still wringing his hands
and bewailing the destruction of his glasses,
&#8220;bring me water and clean linen, and be quick
about it. Ah, here is one who will know how to
dress the wound,&#8221; he added, as a tall, clean-shaven
man, dressed severely in black, pushed his way
through the crowd. &#8220;Upon my word, Levau, you
come in the nick of time. I have a patient for
you,&#8221; and he turned me over to the famous surgeon.</p>

<p>The latter in a moment had examined the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
wound, with puckered brow, washed it in clean
water, spread some cooling lotion upon it, which he
took from a case he carried in his pocket, and securely
bandaged it. Not till then did he deign to
speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;A mere nothing,&#8221; he said, &#8220;for a man who
has good blood in his veins, as my friend here has.
A little soreness for a week, perhaps, a stiffness for
a fortnight, and then only a memory.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, I am wondrous pleased to hear it,&#8221;
said Richelieu, shaking his hand warmly, and leaving
a gold piece in it, I do not doubt. &#8220;But what
have we here?&#8221; and he turned towards the door,
whence came a sudden commotion.</p>

<p>&#8220;For the king!&#8221; cried a voice. &#8220;For the king!
Make way, messieurs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The regent!&#8221; exclaimed some one, and then a
strange stillness fell upon the place, save for Richelieu,
who hummed one of Lulli&#8217;s gay airs.</p>

<p>The crowd parted to right and left, and I saw
advancing towards us a large, heavy-set man, with
red face and eyes which seemed to run one through.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who hath done this?&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Who hath
killed the Comte de Gare, one of my faithful
friends?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>&#8220;To me belongs the honor, monsieur,&#8221; said
Richelieu, in a cool voice, but bowing low. &#8220;I
regret to learn he was a friend of yours, for he was
a coward and a villain, and deserved to die by the
rope, not by the sword like a gentleman.&#8221;</p>

<p>The regent&#8217;s face turned from red to purple,
and I looked to see him rush upon Richelieu, and
half drew my sword. But with an effort he restrained
himself, and his next words came in a
voice strangely calm, yet infinitely more menacing
than any violence could have been.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, I have the honor of seeing the Duc de
Richelieu, have I not? But they tell me there were
two men opposed to de Gare.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Monsieur,&#8221; cried Richelieu, &#8220;whoever said
that lied. A friend of mine interposed to save me
from a treacherous dagger-thrust, which the
coward would have given me when he saw himself
hard pressed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And where is this friend, may I inquire?&#8221;
asked the regent, looking about with an ominous
light in his eyes.</p>

<p>My hat was sweeping the floor in an instant.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have that honor,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know you, monsieur,&#8221; sneered Orleans,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
looking me over from head to foot. &#8220;I
should say, however, that you were from the country,
and I warn you that you have fallen into bad
company. You would better leave it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I choose my own company, monsieur, and ask
no one to do it for me,&#8221; I answered, for the insolent
look of the man had set my blood on fire. &#8220;I
desire no better than that I have already had.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then by my faith you shall see more of it!&#8221;
cried the regent, losing his calmness in an instant.
&#8220;Here, lieutenant,&#8221; he called to an officer
near the door, &#8220;bring in a squad of guards and
arrest these men. I will see if we are to have
roistering and murder at mid-day in the streets of
Paris.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis useless to resist,&#8221; said Richelieu to me in
a low voice as I drew my sword. &#8220;He will not
dare use much severity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your swords, messieurs,&#8221; said the lieutenant
of police, advancing towards us at the head of a
dozen men. Richelieu broke his over his knee and
threw it to the floor. I placed my foot on mine
and snapped the blade.</p>

<p>&#8220;To the Bastille with them!&#8221; cried the regent,
beside himself with rage. &#8220;You shall answer for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
them with your head, lieutenant, so take care they
do not escape.&#8221;</p>

<p>The officer simply bowed, but his cheek flushed
with anger. We were led to the street, where I
saw the regent&#8217;s coach standing. As we emerged
from the caf&eacute; I caught a glimpse of two faces
which seemed familiar, and looking again, I recognized
the men who had entered the place with
de Gare. I understood then how it happened that
the regent had arrived so opportunely. They had
doubtless warned him of de Gare&#8217;s peril, but too
late to save his life.</p>

<p>A moment later we were mounted on two horses,
and, surrounded by our body-guard, galloped
briskly away towards the Bastille, in which, I reflected,
I was like to find much less of comfort than
in the palatial Hotel de Richelieu. Yet a man must
take the lean with the fat, and I was far from repining.</p>

<small>A DESPERATE VENTURE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> troop of guards continued onward at a
rapid pace, separating me from Richelieu, so that I
had no opportunity of exchanging a word with
him. In a few moments the threatening and
gloomy walls of the Bastille loomed ahead, towering
over the Porte St. Antoine, and we drew up
at the outer gate. The lieutenant exchanged a
word with the sentry there, and after a moment
the gates creaked back and we entered. I looked
about me curiously, for this was the first time I
had ever seen the interior of the most famous
prison in France, though I had spent an entire
afternoon looking at it from the other side of the
ditch.</p>

<p>We were in a long court, closed in by lofty walls,
the prison itself forming one side. We turned to
the right, past some houses built against the outer
wall, which I decided were stables, and then the
word was given to dismount. Half a dozen guards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
surrounded us, a bell rang somewhere, and in a
moment a man in uniform hurried towards us,&mdash;a
little, dry man, with tight-shut lips, and eyes
whose glance was like a poniard-thrust.</p>

<p>&#8220;M. de Maison-Rouge,&#8221; said the lieutenant,
saluting with great respect, &#8220;I have here two prisoners,
whom the regent confides to your keeping
with instructions to guard them well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The instructions were unnecessary, monsieur,&#8221;
replied the new-comer, shortly. &#8220;No one who
enters here ever leaves until it is permitted. Who
are the prisoners?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, M. de Maison-Rouge,&#8221; cried Richelieu,
gayly, &#8220;I trust you have not forgotten me so
speedily?&#8221;</p>

<p>The lieutenant-governor of the great prison
glanced at the speaker quickly, but his face remained
impenetrable, and if he experienced any
surprise, he certainly did not show it.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I have not forgotten you, M. le Duc,&#8221; he
said, quietly. &#8220;And the other?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is my friend, Jean de Brancas,&#8221; answered
Richelieu; and added, smilingly, &#8220;It is, I believe,
the first time he has had the pleasure of meeting
you.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>Maison-Rouge glanced at me coldly. I bowed,
but I fear my face betrayed the fact that I considered
the meeting anything but a pleasure.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Wait a moment, lieutenant,
and I will send you a receipt for the prisoners.
Follow me, messieurs,&#8221; he added to us, and
led the way to one of the buildings against the
outer wall, which proved to be his office. A sentry
at the door saluted as we passed. A receipt was
written and given to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, gentlemen,&#8221; said Maison-Rouge, as the
door closed, &#8220;I must be assured that you carry no
weapons or means of escape into the Bastille with
you. Give me your word of honor to that effect
and I will omit the formality of search.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is most courteous, monsieur,&#8221; cried
Richelieu. &#8220;I give you my word of honor gladly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I also,&#8221; I said. &#8220;My sword was my only
weapon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is well,&#8221; and Maison-Rouge opened the
door. &#8220;Follow me, then.&#8221;</p>

<p>Midway of the court a drawbridge grated down
to let us pass and creakingly rose behind us. Turning
again to the right, we were conducted along a
still narrower court to a second gate, and passing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
through this, paused before a second drawbridge,
which was also lowered to permit our passage.
Still another gate was opened and clanged shut
after us, and we were in the great interior court.
The afternoon sun illumined it as brightly as it was
ever illumined, and I perceived two or three melancholy
personages walking slowly up and down,
each in charge of a sentry, who followed closely
with loaded musket and permitted no word to be
exchanged. Three lofty towers flanked the court
on either side. They were fully a hundred feet in
height, as were the walls between them, and the
court itself was near a hundred feet long, by perhaps
seventy in width. We were led straight on
across another drawbridge into a second court,
much smaller than the first, and which resembled
nothing so much as a gigantic well. As I afterwards
found out, it was, indeed, called the well
court.</p>

<p>&#8220;I trust I may have my old room, monsieur,&#8221;
observed Richelieu, as we entered this forbidding
place, which made my heart sink within me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see nothing against it,&#8221; answered Maison-Rouge.
&#8220;The Tower du Puits is certainly strong
enough to hold even the Duc de Richelieu.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>&#8220;That has been proved,&#8221; laughed the duke,
&#8220;since it has already held me for more than a
year. I had no reason to complain of your hospitality,
monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>The governor smiled grimly, but said nothing.
I wondered how my companion could laugh so
lightly in this horrible place.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you are not even curious to know what
brought me here again?&#8221; he continued, in the same
tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some act of folly, I do not doubt,&#8221; said Maison-Rouge,
his face clearing a little. &#8220;You will
never learn discretion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, but this is far less serious,&#8221; cried Richelieu.
&#8220;Before, I offended the prudery of Madame
de Maintenon, who was trying to turn Louis into
a monk and the court into a priory. This time I
have merely killed one of the regent&#8217;s friends. The
regent is a man, and will soon forgive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I trust so,&#8221; and Maison-Rouge glanced at him
with the shadow of a smile. &#8220;I have no reason
to wish you ill, M. le Duc.&#8221; Evidently, the winning
good humor of my companion had touched
even this enfortressed heart.</p>

<p>There was a tower at either corner of the inner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
court, and it was towards the one at the right that
we were led. A door with double bolts barred the
bottom of the staircase. The governor threw them
back, opened the door, and motioned us before
him. I heard the regular step of a sentry in
the corridor above, and we passed him at the first
landing. He paused to glance at us inquiringly,
and then continued his round. At the third landing,
Maison-Rouge stopped before a heavy iron
door, threw back the bolts and pulled it open.
Another inner door was revealed, similarly bolted.
This he also opened and held back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, I am familiar with this room,&#8221; said Richelieu,
smiling as he passed into it. I started to follow him,
but Maison-Rouge motioned me back.</p>

<p>&#8220;What! you would separate me from my
friend?&#8221; cried Richelieu.</p>

<p>&#8220;I regret that it is necessary, monsieur,&#8221; said
the governor; &#8220;but it is the rule, as you should
know. He shall lodge in the calotte above you.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spoke I fancied I caught a flash of triumph
in Richelieu&#8217;s eye, but he made no sign.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-by, then, my friend,&#8221; he said, and turned
away towards the double-barred window. The
doors were clanged shut, the bolts thrown, and I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
was motioned to mount to the floor above. I did
so with a heavy heart. With Richelieu I had some
hope, but without him I felt hope to be fruitless.
Presently we paused before another door, double-bolted
like that on the floor below. Behind it, also,
there was an inner door. It was opened, I entered,
and heard the bolts shot into place. As I looked
back at it I saw that in both doors, near the top
there was a narrow orifice through which the sentry
in the hall could inspect the cells as he passed
and hear what was going on in them.</p>

<p>The calotte was well named, for it was a skullcap
indeed. In the centre there was room to stand
upright, but the roof sloped on either hand until at
the walls it was scarce two feet from the floor. A
bench, a chair, and a rickety stove clamped to the
wall comprised the furniture.</p>

<p>I threw myself upon the bench, when a sudden
thought brought me to my feet as by a spring. For
this was the night upon which Richelieu was to
meet Mlle. de Valois. That he should fail to do
so would be monstrous. Escape, then, was necessary,&mdash;escape,
not to-morrow or next week, but
at once, to-day, within six or eight hours at the
uttermost. I groaned aloud. How to escape from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
this infernal hole? I sprang to the window and
tried the bars. They were cemented fast into the
masonry. The strength of the door I already
knew, and I ran over in my mind the barred gates
and raised drawbridges we must pass before we
should be without the walls. I gazed out through
the bars at the broad country, bright under the rays
of the sun, and cursed the chance that had thrown
us here, upon this day of all days. I heard the
regular step of the sentry in the corridor, as much
a prisoner as ourselves until the watch was
changed. It came nearer, paused before my door,
and then retreated. All was still.</p>

<p>Suddenly I heard a faint tapping as of some one
endeavoring to signal me. I looked around trying
to locate the sound. I approached the corner from
which it seemed to come. It grew louder. I
dropped to my knees and crawled yet nearer the
wall.</p>

<p>&#8220;De Brancas,&#8221; I heard a voice call, seemingly
a great way off. &#8220;De Brancas, are you there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; I panted. &#8220;But where are you,
monsieur?&#8221; for I could not believe that a human
voice could penetrate these walls of stone.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the cell below yours, as you know,&#8221; replied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
the voice. &#8220;Do you know we must escape to-night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; I answered again, still more astonished
that I could hear his voice so clearly. &#8220;The
tryst at the dryad fountain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a jewel, de Brancas!&#8221; cried the duke.
&#8220;Yes, we must escape and at once. There is no
time to lose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But to escape,&#8221; I said, &#8220;it is necessary to pass
through seven barred gates and across three raised
drawbridges. That is no easy thing. Have you
a plan, monsieur?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A plan? No. But let me come to you and we
will find a plan.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let you come to me?&#8221; I cried, in amazement.
&#8220;Gladly, but how?&#8221;</p>

<p>I could hear him laughing to himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you think that I spent a year of my life
here for nothing?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;The slab at the
corner of your cell is loose and can easily be
raised.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was panting with excitement. So this was
how his voice could reach me!</p>

<p>&#8220;A moment!&#8221; I cried, and my fingers groped for
the loosened slab. It was soon found, but how to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
raise it was a question, for I could get no hold of
it. In an instant I had torn the buckle from my
shoe and inserted its edge into the crack. I pried
the stone up, but a dozen times it slipped back before
I could arrest it. Finally I raised it half an
inch, grasped the edge with desperate fingers, and
with an effort which made my muscles crack tilted
it up. I looked into the hole, but could see nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;The slab is out, monsieur,&#8221; I called.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; said Richelieu, and then there was an
instant&#8217;s pause. &#8220;Now,&#8221; he went on, at last, &#8220;as
I raise this other stone do you slide it back out of
the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a moment it was done, and I found myself
looking down into his eyes, so near they almost
startled me, for he had placed his chair upon his
bench and was standing on it.</p>

<p>&#8220;The guard will be back,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Bring
your bench to the corner and lie down upon it.&#8221;</p>

<p>I did as he directed, and saw that he had jumped
down from his chair and was walking carelessly
about his cell. Again the sentry reached the door,
paused an instant to glance within, and then went
on his round.</p>

<p>Richelieu was back upon his chair in an instant.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I can pay you a ten minutes&#8217;
visit. I know the routine of this place,&#8221; and he
held out his hands to me. I reached down, grasped
them, and he scrambled lightly up beside me.</p>

<p>I began to think that, after all, escape might not
be such a difficult thing. What other secrets of the
prison might he not possess?</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis not the first time I have made that trip,&#8221;
and he laughed as he brushed the dust from his
sleeve. &#8220;When the king sent me here to repent of
that affair at Marly he permitted my tutor to accompany
me. But in the evening we were separated,
and he was locked up in this cell to spend the
night. We were both dying of ennui, and determined
to spend the nights together. So with infinite
patience he picked away the cement around
this slab and the one under it. As you see, they rest
on the girders and so remain in place. The guard
cannot see into the cells after night falls, so we
were not disturbed. It is fortunate the corner is
dark,&#8221; he added, &#8220;and that the cracks of the floor
are filled with dirt, else the ruse might have been
discovered since I was last here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And now what?&#8221; I asked, trembling with impatience.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>&#8220;Now to escape,&#8221; said the duke, and sat down
on the bench to consider.</p>

<p>But to escape, and with only our bare hands for
tools! What a problem! Yet I was determined
that it should be solved. Others had escaped from
the Bastille. Why not we?</p>

<p>&#8220;Clearly,&#8221; I said, after a moment, &#8220;we cannot
hope to break down the door nor penetrate these
walls.&#8221;</p>

<p>My companion nodded in gloomy acquiescence.</p>

<p>&#8220;There remains, then, only one possible way,&#8221;
I went on. &#8220;That is by the window.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the bars?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We must remove one. Luckily they are single,
so that one will be enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is ninety feet from the ground.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We must get a rope.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A rope? Yes. But where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know,&#8221; I said, but I arose and went
to the window. Yes, it was not less than ninety
feet from the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Richelieu, at my elbow, &#8220;suppose
we had a rope. Suppose we had the bar out. What
then? Do you not see the court is full of soldiers?
We could not hope to escape them. But even if we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
did, there is the outer wall still to pass,&mdash;forty
feet high and with a sentry at every twenty paces.&#8221;</p>

<p>I saw that what he said was true. To descend
into the court would be to enter a nest of hornets.
But of a sudden a new thought came to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; I asked, &#8220;if one way is impossible,
why not try the other?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The other?&#8221; exclaimed Richelieu. &#8220;What
other, de Brancas?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The roof,&#8221; I cried, and I knew I had found
the key to the problem. &#8220;It is battlemented, is it
not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; and Richelieu looked more and more astonished.
&#8220;But I do not yet understand, my
friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; I said. &#8220;Let me think a moment,&#8221;
and I sat down upon the bench, my head between
my hands. Richelieu paced feverishly up and
down the cell. At last I had it.</p>

<p>&#8220;M. le Duc,&#8221; I said, as calmly as I could, for
my heart was beating madly, &#8220;I have a plan. It
is not promising, perhaps, but I believe it is the best
that offers. I will remove one of the bars of the
window. We will secure a rope. I will stand upon
the sill without and throw the rope over a merlon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
of the battlement. We will mount to the roof and
after that trust to Providence. There must be
some way down, and if there is, we will find it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Richelieu&#8217;s eyes were blazing.</p>

<p>&#8220;But can we do all this?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must,&#8221; I said. &#8220;The most difficult thing
is the rope. It must be twenty or thirty feet long,
and strong enough to bear us. If we had our
cloaks&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will get our cloaks,&#8221; cried Richelieu. &#8220;I will
make the rope. Come, I must return. The guard
will soon be here. Slip the stones into place after
me,&#8221; and he dropped lightly into his cell.</p>

<p>I dropped the stones back into place, and heard
him pounding at his door. The sentry answered
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no bedding in this place,&#8221; called
Richelieu, &#8220;and it will be cold to-night. At least
I and my friend should have our cloaks. Ask M.
de Maison-Rouge if he will not send to my hotel
and secure us two good, heavy ones.&#8221;</p>

<p>The guard went away, but soon came back again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your request is granted, monsieur,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;You shall have your cloak,&#8221; and then he mounted
to my door and repeated the message to me.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>I had the slabs out again in a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;That provides the rope,&#8221; I said, looking down
into the duke&#8217;s excited face. &#8220;Now it is for me
to remove the bar. It will make some noise. Do
you listen for the sentry and warn me when he
approaches.&#8221;</p>

<p>Richelieu nodded, and turned away to listen at
his door.</p>

<p>I went to the window and examined it bar by
bar. None of them showed any sign of weakness,
but at one end of the second bar from the bottom
there was a little crack in the cement. I must have
something to use as a chisel. But what? My eyes
fell upon the stove. It was falling to pieces, and I
wrenched loose a portion of the side, which would
do admirably for a maul. But for a chisel I must
have something with a point,&mdash;why not one of the
clamps which held it to the wall? They had been
driven into the cement, how far I could not guess.
I chose the one which seemed a little loose, and
using the piece of iron for a lever, managed to start
it. A second wrench, a third&mdash;and I had it out.
It was a sorry chisel, but must do, in want of something
better. I muffled my handkerchief about the
piece of iron in order to deaden the noise as much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
as possible and attacked the cement about the bar.
I saw that I could chip it away a little at a time.</p>

<p>So I toiled on through the afternoon, Richelieu
warning me when the sentry approached along the
corridor. It was weary work, yet my heart was
light, for I had soon made a considerable impression,
and knew I should succeed. My arms were
aching and my hands were torn and blistered, but
as evening came one end of the bar was loose, and
I felt that I could pull it out. I stopped work then,
told Richelieu of my success, and carefully gathering
up the cement which I had loosened, threw it
under the floor, and slipped the stones back into
place. I drove the clamp back into the wall, replaced
the piece of stove, and threw myself upon
my bench to rest.</p>

<p>Scarcely had I done so when I heard footsteps
approaching. The door opened and a man appeared
upon the threshold carrying my supper, and
I caught a glimpse of the guard standing in the
dark corridor behind him. He placed the food
upon the floor, went out again, and returned in a
moment with a cloak, which he threw upon the
chair, and withdrew without a word, bolting the
doors behind him. I caught up the cloak, and saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
with satisfaction that it was a strong and heavy
one. But before I set to work upon it I turned to
the food. A square of bread, a piece of meat,
another of cheese, and a bottle of vile wine was all;
but I was in no mood to quarrel with it, for I had
eaten nothing since morning, and soon devoured
it to the last morsel. Then I tore the cloak into
broad strips and twisted and knotted them together.
At the end of half an hour I had a strong
rope, not less than twenty feet in length. A tap
on the floor told me that Richelieu had also completed
his task, and I sat down to wait for darkness.</p>

<p>It was not long in coming, and so soon as I saw
from my window that night had fallen in earnest,
I raised the slabs and pulled Richelieu up beside
me. Then I dropped the stones back into place, so
that, when our escape was discovered, our means
of communication might not be too readily disclosed.
Richelieu had brought with him the rope
which he had made, and I knotted both ends of it
to mine, making a great loop. Then I sprang to
the window and wrenched out the bar.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are ready,&#8221; I said, and I felt my arms
trembling with excitement.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>Richelieu reached out and wrung my hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will go first,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; I cried, and before he could prevent
me I had pushed my body between the bars and
was clinging to the sill without.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br />


<small>A SURPRISE FOR MAISON-ROUGE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was narrow foothold, and my head
whirled for an instant as I clung to the bars with
one hand and looked down at the flickering torches
in the court below and along the outer wall. But
the giddiness passed, and I leaned far out and
vainly tried to pierce the darkness above me. The
wall sloped outward at the height of my head, so
that I could not see the top, but I had seen the parapet
in daylight from a distance and knew that the
merlons were narrow and spiked along the crest.
It was over one of these that I must throw my rope,
and I drew a deep breath as I nerved myself for
the effort. Once, twice, I threw, with a long, outward
sweep of the arm, and each time the rope fell
back past me. Three, four, five times, but each
time it came back without resistance. I paused for
breath, and heard Richelieu cursing softly at the
window. I leaned far out and threw the sixth
time. The rope held. I bore my weight upon it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
still clinging to the bars with one hand. It still
held. Obviously, what I had hoped for had happened.</p>

<p>And then I paused, while the perspiration started
in beads at the roots of my hair. As the wall
sloped outward above me, I saw that so soon as I
grasped the rope and loosed my hold on the bars of
the window I would be swung outward. But
there was no time to hesitate, and I feared that
if I stopped to think my heart would fail me, so
closing my eyes, I grasped the rope and let myself
go. In a moment I was dangling like a fly over the
abyss. Gripping my teeth, I went up hand over
hand to the parapet, straining my wounded shoulder
grievously, grasped the top of the battlement,
pulled myself over, and fell limp as a rag on the
other side. A moment later I heard a scratching
against the wall, and Richelieu scrambled over beside
me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not move,&#8221; he whispered, crouching under
the parapet; &#8220;I hear footsteps.&#8221;</p>

<p>I also heard them, and saw faintly a sentry approaching
with musket on his shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis our salvation,&#8221; I whispered, for in an instant
I saw a way of escape.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>&#8220;Our salvation?&#8221; questioned Richelieu.</p>

<p>&#8220;Make no noise, monsieur,&#8221; I answered, &#8220;and
I will show you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sentry was opposite us. A step more and he
had passed. In that instant I was upon him, my
fingers at his throat. Before he could utter a
sound, or, indeed, understand what had happened,
I had dragged him down into the shadow. Richelieu
caught his gun as it fell, and seizing the rope
from the parapet, had bound his feet together in
a trice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quick, quick!&#8221; I whispered. &#8220;Perhaps there
is another sentry. This one must not be missed.&#8221;</p>

<p>I stripped off the fellow&#8217;s coat, while Richelieu
stuffed his handkerchief into his mouth. Then we
tied his hands, gagged him, and rolled him into the
shadow. I threw on his coat, donned his hat,
picked up his musket, and continued along his beat.
A moment later I saw the form of another sentry
approaching through the gloom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Montjoy,&#8221; he cried, as he neared me.</p>

<p>The old battle-cry of France flashed into my
mind in an instant. I can call it nothing less than
inspiration.</p>

<p>&#8220;St. Denis,&#8221; I answered.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>&#8220;All&#8217;s well,&#8221; said the man, and passed me.</p>

<p>It was a simple thing to reach out and clutch his
windpipe. Richelieu heard the struggle and ran
to my assistance. I tore our rope into shorter
pieces, and in a moment the fellow was secured.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are there any others?&#8221; asked the duke.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;Wait and I will
make the circuit.&#8221; I picked up the gun again and
started on the round. I completed it without encountering
any one. &#8220;There are only two sentries,&#8221;
I said, as I rejoined Richelieu.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; he answered; &#8220;and now what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My plan is to put on the clothes of these men
and take their guns. When the guard is changed
we will descend, and will perhaps be permitted to
go out without question. If any one tries to
stop us, we must kill him. At least, we shall be
armed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Splendid!&#8221; cried Richelieu. &#8220;By my soul, de
Brancas, you are a man after my own heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us see how long we have to wait,&#8221; I said,
and loosened the gag in the mouth of our first
prisoner. &#8220;Tell us, fellow,&#8221; I said to him, &#8220;how
soon are the guards changed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In an hour,&#8221; he answered, sullenly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>I replaced the gag, and as I did so a new difficulty
struck me.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must get rid of these men,&#8221; I said. &#8220;If
the guards who come after us find them, they will
give the alarm, and the prison will be aroused in
a moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But we cannot kill them,&#8221; cried Richelieu, and
I heard the two prisoners breathing heavily.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; I answered; &#8220;but we must get rid of
them, nevertheless. Wait a moment,&#8221; and I made
a rapid circuit of the roof. &#8220;I have it. The chimneys.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The chimneys?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; why not? We can lift them over and
drop them inside.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But they would fall to the bottom.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps not. Let me see,&#8221; and I ran to the
nearest chimney, drew myself to the top of it, and
carefully let myself down within. My feet encountered
an obstacle, and I cautiously bore my weight
upon it. It seemed quite firm, and I released my
hold of the chimney and stooped down to investigate.
I found that I was standing upon a heavy
iron grating solidly embedded in the masonry. In
a moment I understood. It had been placed there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
to prevent any one crawling up the chimney and
perhaps escaping. There was a certain grim
humor in the thought that this grating, which had
been designed to prevent escape, should be of assistance
to us. &#8220;Come, this is excellent,&#8221; I said,
clambering out, and I explained to Richelieu what
I had found. &#8220;One man in each chimney, well
bound and gagged. I warrant you they will not
be soon discovered.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But they will be smothered!&#8221; exclaimed the
duke.</p>

<p>&#8220;By what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By smoke and heat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, you forget, monsieur,&#8221; I said, &#8220;how few
fires there are in the Bastille, and how small are
the few which do exist.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True,&#8221; murmured Richelieu; and added,
&#8220;You seem to think of everything, my friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the work of only a few moments to strip
our prisoners and draw their clothes on over our
own. Each had a dagger in his belt, and these
also we appropriated. Our hats we dropped down
the chimney nearest us.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, my friends,&#8221; I said to the two men,
who were shivering in the icy wind which swept<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
across the building, &#8220;you are soon to be in a
warmer place. No, do not fear, we are not going
to harm you,&mdash;that is, if you keep still. We are
going to slip each of you down one of those chimneys,
where, about six feet from the top, there is
a grating upon which you can stand very comfortably.
I promise you, moreover, that if you
are quiet and do not struggle we will send a message
to the governor in the morning telling him
where you are, so that he can release you.&#8221;</p>

<p>I saw that the gags were fast and that their
hands and feet were securely bound. Then I
mounted the chimney and, with the assistance of
Richelieu, pulled one of the prisoners to the top and
lowered him inside. I felt him shudder as he
swung over the inky pit, but his feet soon found
the grating, and in a moment he was standing in
safety and quite invisible from the roof. The same
man&#339;uvre was repeated at the other chimney, I
having first assured myself that it was also grated,
and Richelieu and I were left alone upon the parapet.
All of this had taken time, and we knew the
moment of the relief could not be far distant. We
picked up the muskets and started to patrol the
roof.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>&#8220;The pass-word,&#8221; I said to Richelieu, &#8220;is Montjoy
and St. Denis.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And how under heaven do you know that, my
friend?&#8221; he asked, in amazement.</p>

<p>&#8220;By inspiration,&#8221; I answered, and left him to
his astonishment. We had made the round scarce
half a dozen times when we heard a door unbolted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Montjoy,&#8221; cried a voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;St. Denis,&#8221; we answered, from different parts
of the roof.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, <i>mes enfants</i>,&#8221; cried the voice; &#8220;step
lively, if you please.&#8221;</p>

<p>A faint light appeared, and we hastened towards
it.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are to report at once to the governor,&#8221;
said the man, who by his uniform I saw to be an
officer. &#8220;Two of the guards are ill to-night and
you will have to do double duty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very good, monsieur,&#8221; I answered, and saluting,
we hurried down the steps, exchanging the
pass-word with the two guards who were mounting
to relieve us. Luckily we knew the location of
the governor&#8217;s office. The darkness favored us,
and at the magic words Montjoy and St. Denis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
the drawbridge was lowered and the gates were
opened into the outer court.</p>

<p>&#8220;This way,&#8221; said Richelieu, &#8220;and pray heaven
he be alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>We hastened towards a lighted window, which
we could see distinctly through the darkness.
Richelieu peered into the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is he,&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;He is sitting at a
table writing, with his back to the door. I think
he is alone. We must surprise him. Are you
ready?&#8221; and he drew his dagger from his belt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I said, &#8220;I am quite ready,&#8221; and I also
drew my dagger.</p>

<p>He opened the door noiselessly, and we entered
quickly. I shot the bolts into place, and with one
spring Richelieu was at the side of Maison-Rouge,
his poniard against his throat.</p>

<p>&#8220;One sound, one movement,&#8221; he said, between
his teeth, &#8220;and you are a dead man, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>Maison-Rouge looked around with a start, felt
the dagger against his neck, and like a discreet
man remained silent, his face impassive as ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, de Brancas, quick. A gag and some
rope.&#8221; I found both without difficulty. &#8220;We
forget the window,&#8221; cried Richelieu, suddenly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
&#8220;Close it, man.&#8221; I closed the iron shutter so that
not a ray of light could be seen from without, and
Maison-Rouge was soon secured.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Richelieu, &#8220;let us go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On the contrary, let us stay,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;How, stay? Are you mad?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all. Alone, we shall never be able to
pass the outer gate. Only M. de Maison-Rouge
can get us out. The question is, will he do it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hardly,&#8221; said Richelieu.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe that he will,&#8221; I said, &#8220;when he has
fully considered the situation. One question, M.
le Duc. Do you wish to leave Paris?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet, if you escape, you will have to leave
Paris, will you not, and perhaps France?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I fear so,&#8221; said Richelieu, gloomily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, now I am sure that you will favor my plan.
Now, M. de Maison-Rouge, attention. Let me
tell you first that we have a very important engagement
for this evening, which we are determined
to keep. If we escape, leaving you behind
here, your prestige is lost. Conceive the anger of
the regent when he finds that you have permitted
to slip through your fingers the two prisoners<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
whom he had especially charged you to watch
closely.&#8221;</p>

<p>A groan escaped the unfortunate man. His impassiveness
yielded to this blow, as I had thought
it would.</p>

<p>&#8220;On the other hand, what I propose to you is
this. You order your coach, we enter with you,
you drive out through the gates, announcing that
you go on a mission of importance. Three hours
later you drive in again, we with you.&#8221; I saw
both men start. &#8220;You will send us back to our
second watch on the roof. We release the two
sentries, who will not have been discovered, return
them their uniforms, secure their silence, regain
our rooms, and remove all traces of our flight.
Everything will be as it was before, and when in
the morning the regent sends to inquire after his
prisoners, you can inform him that they are safe.
Does the plan strike you favorably, monsieur?&#8221;</p>

<p>I had been watching him closely as I talked and
I was satisfied that he would consent. I loosened
the gag.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you consent, monsieur?&#8221; I repeated.</p>

<p>&#8220;What assurance have I that you will return
with me?&#8221; he asked.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>&#8220;My word of honor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And yours also, M. le Duc?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, mine also,&#8221; answered Richelieu.</p>

<p>&#8220;Messieurs,&#8221; said Maison-Rouge, &#8220;I understand
nothing of all this, but I am in your power.
I will do anything to keep my prisoners. I consent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what assurance have we?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;My word of honor also.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That will do,&#8221; said Richelieu. &#8220;Besides, we
have always our poniards.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us make haste, then,&#8221; I cried, and I untied
Maison-Rouge, first assuring myself that he was
unarmed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Unbolt the door,&#8221; he said. Richelieu did so.
The governor rang a bell. A man entered, and I
saw Richelieu grip his dagger convulsively. At
least, Maison-Rouge would not escape if he showed
a sign of treachery.</p>

<p>&#8220;My coach, at once,&#8221; said the governor. &#8220;Inform
Lieutenant Perrault that he is to take my
place here until I return from a mission of importance.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man saluted and withdrew. I drew a breath
of relief, and I felt that my forehead was damp<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
with perspiration for the second time that night.
Maison-Rouge donned his cloak and hat. Five
tense minutes passed. Then the door opened and
the man reappeared.</p>

<p>&#8220;The coach is waiting, monsieur,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; replied the governor. &#8220;And Perrault?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will be here in a moment, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We will not wait for him. Follow me, my
men,&#8221; and he led the way to a coach whose lanterns
gleamed through the darkness. He entered
first and we followed him. We were stopped
at the drawbridge, and the sentry thrust in his
head to be certain that it was really the governor
of the Bastille who passed.</p>

<p>&#8220;All&#8217;s well,&#8221; he cried. The drawbridge
creaked down and we rumbled over. There was
a moment&#8217;s delay at the outer gate, then it was
opened and we were free.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where to, monsieur?&#8221; asked the coachman,
drawing up outside the gate.</p>

<p>I whispered in the governor&#8217;s ear.</p>

<p>&#8220;To the Hotel de Richelieu,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>Not a word was spoken as we dashed through
the almost deserted streets, and we were soon in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
the Rue des Saints P&egrave;res. The coachman stopped
before the central gate of the hotel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a moment here,&#8221; said Richelieu, and he
sprang from the coach, ran to the gate, and rang
the bell. A lacquey answered the summons, and
after a whispered word with him Richelieu motioned
us forward. As we passed he stepped again
into the coach, and the gate was closed behind us.
In a moment we were at the great entrance of the
house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come with us, monsieur,&#8221; I said to Maison-Rouge,
and motioned him to get out first.</p>

<p>&#8220;The governor wishes you on no account to
leave this place,&#8221; I said to the driver as we descended.
&#8220;M. de Maison-Rouge intends to look
through the papers of M. de Richelieu. It may
take some time, but you are to await him here.&#8221;</p>

<p>The coachman, well drilled, doubtless, in his
master&#8217;s peculiar business, nodded to show that he
understood.</p>

<p>We mounted the steps, and Richelieu knocked at
the door. It was opened by Jacques, who recognized
his master at once and admitted us without
a word.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jacques,&#8221; said Richelieu, as the door closed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
&#8220;you will conduct this gentleman to the red salon.
Call two of my men and let them assist you in
guarding him. On no account is he to escape or
communicate with any one. You will, however,
provide him with wine and whatever else he may
require.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man bowed and led our prisoner down a
corridor to the left. Richelieu sprang up the
stairs, and I followed him to the apartment we had
entered the evening before. Here he paused.</p>

<p>&#8220;De Brancas,&#8221; he said, turning to me and grasping
my hand, &#8220;you are sublime, my friend. Believe
me, I shall never forget it.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br />


<small>AT THE DRYAD FOUNTAIN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;We</span> shall need disguises,&#8221; said Richelieu, as
I returned his clasp with equal warmth. &#8220;Luckily,
I have already had many occasions for using
them, and so have a large assortment. Come with
me,&#8221; and he led the way into an adjoining room,
whose walls were covered with costumes. There
were uniforms of many kinds, cavaliers&#8217; suits of
a dozen fashions and even the more sober garb of
artisans and masons. At one end of the room was
a collection of arms,&mdash;swords, poniards, pistols,
arquebuses, and even shirts of mail. &#8220;Choose,&#8221;
said Richelieu, with a sweep of his hand. &#8220;As for
me, I shall take this suit of gray. I am known to
abhor gray, and moreover it will make me invisible
in the darkness.&#8221;</p>

<p>The reason seemed to me a good one, and I
selected a suit of similar shade but much less
elaborate design.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I had near forgot!&#8221; I exclaimed, returning,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
as I was leaving the room. &#8220;Will you instruct
one of your people to prepare against our return a
small box of cement?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cement?&#8221; asked Richelieu, looking at me in
astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; we shall need it,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, my friend,&#8221; he said, and without
waiting to explain the use I had for it, I hurried
to my apartment, where I changed my clothes,
rolling my others into a bundle, which I carried
down with me to Richelieu&#8217;s room five minutes
later. I found him busily engaged in curling his
moustache and arranging his hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have no time to lose, monsieur,&#8221; I protested.</p>

<p>&#8220;What the devil would you have, de Brancas?&#8221;
and Richelieu threw around his neck a collar which
I knew to be that of the Holy Ghost, with its eight-pointed
cross, each point crowned by a ball. &#8220;A
gentleman cannot go to a rendezvous looking like
a bourgeois. I have ordered two horses, and I
shall be ready to mount by the time they are at the
door. You would better select a sword, a poniard,
and a pistol, for you may have need of them before
the night is over.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>I did as he suggested, and in a few minutes we
were in the saddle. We crossed the river at a gallop,
and without drawing rein plunged into a maze
of narrow streets where I should have been utterly
lost, but where Richelieu seemed quite at home. I
expected every moment that my horse would break
his leg in some hole in the pavement, but my companion
did not slacken speed, and I pressed on behind
him. I remembered that the rendezvous was
in the Palais Royal gardens, and reflected without
enthusiasm that this was walking into the lion&#8217;s
jaws with a vengeance, but I kept my thoughts to
myself, and in a moment we turned sharply to the
left along a narrow street and came out at the end
of a long avenue of chestnuts.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the place,&#8221; said Richelieu, and we
walked our horses into the shadow of the trees and
dismounted. &#8220;We will tie our horses here. The
fountain is not far distant, and we shall have no
difficulty in regaining them should we be surprised.
Ah! &#8217;tis the hour,&#8221; he added, as ten o&#8217;clock sounded
from St. Honor&eacute;. &#8220;In two hours we must be back
in the Bastille. &#8217;Tis well that the night is cold,&#8221;
he continued, leading the way rapidly along the
avenue, &#8220;else our task would have been more difficult,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
for this is a great place of resort in fine
weather.&#8221;</p>

<p>Some distance away, through the leafless
branches of the trees, I could see the lights of the
Palais Royal gleaming. The moon had risen and
shed a cold radiance over the gardens, beautiful
even under December&#8217;s withering hand. Only
under the broad branches of the chestnuts was
there obscurity, and we kept carefully in the
shadow.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is the fountain,&#8221; said Richelieu at the
end of a moment, &#8220;but I see no one. Can it be
that she has disappointed me? Perhaps she heard
I had been imprisoned and thought I could not
come. Ah, there is some one standing in the
shadow. It must be she!&#8221; and he ran quickly
forward.</p>

<p>I thought it much more likely to be a squad
of the regent&#8217;s guards, but kept close at his elbow,
determined to have a hand in whatever might befall.
A moment later I saw two muffled figures
standing near the fountain, and to these Richelieu
ran.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Charlotte!&#8221; he cried, falling on his knee
before one of them, the instinct of his heart telling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
him which was the princess. &#8220;I protest to you that
only the most cruel chance made us a moment late.
I shall never cease to reproach myself for having
kept you waiting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And is it indeed you, M. le Duc?&#8221; asked a low
voice, and I saw that Richelieu had gained possession
of a hand and was covering it with kisses.
&#8220;But I heard this evening that my father had sent
you to the Bastille.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So he did,&#8221; said Richelieu, &#8220;but did you believe
any prison in France strong enough to keep
me from your side, Charlotte?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You escaped, then? But how?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For that we have to thank my friend here,&#8221;
and Richelieu drew me forward. &#8220;Mademoiselle,
allow me to present M. Jean de Brancas, a gentleman
whom I have learned to trust as I would myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And who hopes some day to be of service to
Mlle. de Valois,&#8221; I added, bowing over the hand
which she graciously gave me.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have already been of service to me, monsieur,&#8221;
she said, kindly, &#8220;in assisting M. de Richelieu
to escape from prison. But I also have a
companion. Come here, Louise. Gentlemen, this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
is my very dear friend Mlle. Louise Dacour, my
trust in whom, I think, is fully attested by her
being here to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>We both bowed to her, and I caught a glimpse
of laughing eyes and an adorable mouth, which
made my heart leap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us go,&#8221; said Richelieu, offering his arm
to the princess.</p>

<p>&#8220;But where?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I care not so we be together,&#8221; and as they
moved away down the avenue I followed with
Mlle. Dacour. The light touch of her hand on
my arm filled me with an emotion which I tried
in vain to analyze.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, come, M. de Brancas,&#8221; she said after a moment,
in what seemed to me the sweetest voice in
the world. &#8220;It is plainly to be seen that you have
never been in love.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never until this moment, mademoiselle, I
swear to you,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;But how did you
guess it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, you are not in love even now, I assure
you, monsieur,&#8221; she laughed, &#8220;else you would not
follow mademoiselle and the duke so closely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is true,&#8221; I said; &#8220;I was thoughtless,&#8221; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
we walked more slowly until the two in front of us
could be scarcely discerned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now tell me,&#8221; said my companion, with a little
gesture of command, &#8220;how did you leave the Bastille,
monsieur?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We opened seven doors, lowered three drawbridges,
and came out very easily, mademoiselle,&#8221;
I answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall not evade me,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Tell me
about it. I have already heard something of your
exploits since you came to Paris, M. de Brancas,&#8221;
she added, &#8220;and am anxious to hear more.&#8221;</p>

<p>I trembled with joy at the thought that I had,
perhaps, already awakened some interest in the
heart of this beautiful creature, and rapidly outlined
our method of escape.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was magnificent!&#8221; she cried, as I finished.
&#8220;Those are the kind of deeds I love to hear about,&#8221;
and her sparkling eyes looked into mine. I felt that
I was losing my self-control, and my heart was
beating wildly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not guess the happiness that awaited me
here,&#8221; I said, &#8220;nor have I ever dreamed of loveliness
such as yours, mademoiselle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is evident that you have seen little of Paris,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
monsieur,&#8221; she retorted, glancing at me and
smiling archly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish to see no more,&#8221; I cried. &#8220;Ah, mademoiselle,
believe me, I may be but a simple and uncultured
boor, but I mean to win for myself a
place in your heart if it be possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>She glanced at me again, I dared think not unkindly,
and I felt her hand fluttering on my arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;I deem you neither simple nor uncultured, M.
de Brancas,&#8221; she said, after a moment. &#8220;Indeed,
the stories I have heard of you have given me quite
the contrary opinion. But pray where have you
seen my face, that you have been able to form such
an exalted opinion of it?&#8221; and she smiled at me, her
eyes dancing with mischief.</p>

<p>&#8220;I caught but a glimpse of it by the fountain
there, but a glimpse was quite enough,&#8221; I answered,
stoutly. &#8220;Besides, I make bold to hope
that by accident your cloak may yet slip down and
reveal more of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was trembling at my own temerity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, I like your spirit, monsieur,&#8221; she answered,
gayly. &#8220;Have it as you will, then,&#8221; and
at the word her cloak fell about her shoulders.
Her dazzling eyes met mine, her mouth was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
curving in the most provoking of smiles. Some
wizardry drew me towards her.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; she said, divining my thought and
holding up a little hand to keep me at a distance.
&#8220;This is favor enough for one evening,&#8221; but I
caught her hand and kissed it before she could
draw it away. &#8220;Come, we have forgot completely
our companions. We must join them.&#8221;</p>

<p>I had, indeed, forgotten Richelieu, and I remembered
with a start that our time of freedom must
be getting short. I peered anxiously through the
darkness, but could see no sign of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps they are at the fountain,&#8221; said Mlle.
Dacour, and we hastened thither, but to no purpose.
I was about to call aloud, when I heard a sudden
shout and clash of arms from the direction of the
Palais Royal.</p>

<p>&#8220;They have found him!&#8221; I cried. &#8220;He never
thinks of prudence. Come, mademoiselle, let me
see you to a place of safety. I must join him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, do not delay!&#8221; she implored. &#8220;I am
perfectly safe, monsieur. Our apartments are but
a step from here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Impossible! I cannot leave you alone. Come,&#8221;
I repeated.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>She wrung her hands together as she looked at
me.</p>

<p>&#8220;M. de Brancas, you said to me just now that
you would have me think kindly of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With all my heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you have me believe it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would do anything to prove it,&#8221; I cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then go.&#8221; I looked into her eyes, which were
flaming with excitement, caught her hand and
kissed it. It nestled in mine for a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Adieu, mademoiselle,&#8221; I said, and was off under
the trees. The sounds grew louder as I approached,
and it was evident that the whole palace
had been aroused. Windows were thrown open,
soldiers were pouring out of a room in the left
wing, and near the edge of the garden five or six
men had a single man surrounded. At a glance I
saw the latter to be Richelieu. He had placed his
back against a tree and was fencing coolly. Even
as I ran I saw one of his assailants totter and fall.
I kept on without a sound, reached the group, and
ran a man through before they perceived they were
attacked in the rear. They gave back a pace.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, monsieur,&#8221; I cried, &#8220;there will be
others here in a moment.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>&#8220;Ah, gentlemen,&#8221; said Richelieu, saluting with
his sword in careless disregard of the thrusts aimed
at him, &#8220;believe me, were there only yourselves
we should not think of leaving until our argument
had reached a conclusion, but as it is, I regret that
we must go.&#8221; And then he added to me, in a lower
tone, &#8220;Retreat towards the horses. If we can
reach them we are safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>I heard hurrying feet from the direction of the
palace and did not doubt that we should be overwhelmed
unless we reached the horses quickly.
Richelieu had disabled another of our opponents, so
that there were only three, and these drew off and
followed us more warily. I saw others hastening
towards us under the trees, but we had not far to
go, and soon reached the horses.</p>

<p>&#8220;Charge them!&#8221; I cried, for they were just out
of sword reach.</p>

<p>Our nearest pursuers retreated before us, and in
the instant of time that followed we threw ourselves
into the saddle. As we dashed out into the
open an overhanging branch caught my companion&#8217;s
hat and tore it from his head, leaving his
face fully exposed in the bright moonlight.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis Richelieu!&#8221; cried one of the men. With<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
an oath, the duke snatched a pistol from the holster
and fired. The man threw his arms above his
head and fell like a log. In a flash we were out of
the avenue and in the city.</p>

<p>There was need of haste, for once the regent
should learn that Richelieu had been in the garden,
he would lose no time in getting to the Bastille
to find out the truth. So we put spurs to our
horses and dashed on like the wind, raising a veritable
cannonade of echoes. In ten minutes we were
at the Hotel de Richelieu, and throwing our bridles
to a lacquey, rushed up the stairs, tore off our masquerades,
and drew on our old suits, and over them
the suits of the two sentries.</p>

<p>&#8220;One moment,&#8221; I said, as Richelieu started out
of the room; &#8220;we shall need money, monsieur.
Have you any?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right,&#8221; cried the duke, and he ran to a
secretary, opened it, and filled his pockets with
pistoles. &#8220;Now we are ready. Come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The cement?&#8221; I asked. &#8220;Where is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; and Richelieu handed me a small package
from the table. I placed it carefully in a pocket
of my own suit.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; I cried, and we descended the stairs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
in three bounds. Richelieu led the way along
the corridor down which Jacques had taken his
prisoner two hours before. He paused before
a door and tried to open it. It was locked on the
inside.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is there?&#8221; cried a voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is I, Richelieu; open quickly.&#8221; The bolt
was thrown and the door opened. Inside were
Jacques and two other men, while Maison-Rouge
was pacing nervously up and down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, messieurs,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;I thought you
were never coming! It is near midnight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have still ten minutes,&#8221; said Richelieu,
coolly, &#8220;but there is no time to lose. Come,&#8221; and
he led the way towards the door. We picked up
the muskets as we passed through the hall, and as
the door opened we fell a pace behind Maison-Rouge,
and resuming our character of simple sentries,
followed him to the carriage.</p>

<p>&#8220;To the Bastille!&#8221; cried the governor, and in a
moment we were thundering along the street.</p>

<p>&#8220;M. de Maison-Rouge,&#8221; said Richelieu, in a low
voice, &#8220;do not be astonished if you receive an
early visit from the regent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From the regent? And why so?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>&#8220;My friend and I had the misfortune to encounter
some of the regent&#8217;s guards this evening,&#8221;
said the duke, calmly, &#8220;and I fear that I was
recognized.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The devil!&#8221; exclaimed Maison-Rouge. &#8220;Then
all is lost.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; I said, quickly. &#8220;At twelve
o&#8217;clock we will be sent to the roof to go on guard.
We will regain our rooms and remove all traces
of our flight. You, monsieur, will go directly to
bed, and should you be aroused, must consume as
much time as possible in putting on your clothes.
Even if the regent is right at our heels, that will
give us at least ten minutes, and ten minutes is
more than we shall need. I think when you show
him that you have us safe, he will have little more
to say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I trust so, at least,&#8221; murmured Maison-Rouge,
&#8220;though I confess I do not understand how you
will accomplish all this. Until to-night I had
thought the Bastille impregnable, but you seem to
have found some miraculous way of leaving your
cells and entering them again.&#8221;</p>

<p>I smiled as I encountered his dazed glance, but
I judged it best to say nothing more. A moment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
later we reached the prison, the gates of which
opened to the governor&#8217;s coach on the instant.
There was a short delay at the first drawbridge,
where the sentry again peered into the coach to see
that all was right. Then we were in the court, the
carriage stopped and we sprang out, just as midnight
pealed from the tower.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lieutenant Perrault,&#8221; said the governor to a
man who hastened towards us and saluted, &#8220;let
Bastien and Drouet here take the next watch on the
parapet. To-morrow let them have a holiday to
repay for this double duty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very good, monsieur,&#8221; answered the lieutenant.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have nothing to report?&#8221; asked the governor,
sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing, monsieur. Everything has gone as
usual.&#8221; I breathed a sigh of relief. The prisoners
in the chimneys had not, then, been discovered.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is all, lieutenant,&#8221; said the governor. &#8220;I
am going to bed immediately. Awake me if there
is need.&#8221;</p>

<p>We saluted and followed Perrault. I blessed
the impenetrable darkness of the narrow court
which rendered it impossible to recognize friend or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
foe, and we walked in silence across the drawbridge
and up the winding staircase.</p>

<p>&#8220;Montjoy,&#8221; cried Perrault, opening the door
which led to the roof.</p>

<p>&#8220;St. Denis,&#8221; two voices answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurry up,&#8221; cried Perrault. &#8220;It&#8217;s devilishly
cold up here.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two sentries appeared and descended the
stairs. We emerged upon the roof.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have my sympathy, comrades,&#8221; said Perrault,
and closed the door.</p>

<p>There was not a moment to lose. I ran to the
nearest chimney, clambered to the top and felt inside.
I found the prisoner&#8217;s head in an instant.
Catching him by the shoulders, I dragged him to
the top and lowered him to Richelieu, who awaited
him below. The other prisoner was soon standing
beside him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Messieurs,&#8221; I said to them, &#8220;we have returned,
as you see, and I wish you to listen to me very
carefully. There remains only one thing for us to
do. That is to silence you.&#8221; I saw them shudder.
&#8220;It is necessary only to decide how you are to be
silenced. In short, you must either engage to keep
silence or we shall be obliged to silence you once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
and for all. Which do you prefer, a hundred pistoles
each or a blow of the poniard and a drop over
the parapet?&#8221; I loosened their gags as I spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Monsieur,&#8221; said one of them, &#8220;a fool could
choose. I will take the pistoles, will not you, Bastien?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I, also,&#8221; answered his comrade, readily, &#8220;provided
no one else knows of your escape, messieurs?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No one knows of it. Every one thought we
were you. At the end of the watch you will be relieved;
you will go down. To-morrow you will
have a holiday in which to spend your pistoles. If
any one interrogates you, swear that no one passed
this way. You will be quite safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you, messieurs?&#8221; asked Bastien.</p>

<p>&#8220;We return to our cells, and everything is as it
was before. Do you agree?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We agree,&#8221; they cried with one voice, though
by the way they looked at us it was plain they
thought us fools to have returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very good. Now we will unbind you, and
you will go to the other side of the parapet. We
will take off your uniforms and leave them here
with your muskets. After we have descended, you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
will come and loosen the rope which you will find
secured here. Let it fall, as we wish to keep it.
You understand?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; they cried. Richelieu counted out
two hundred pistoles and placed them by the muskets.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here is the money,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>I untied the ropes and the two men retreated to
the other side of the roof. In a moment I had
knotted the pieces of rope together, made one end
secure and dropped the other over.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will go first,&#8221; I said. &#8220;The knots may slip,&#8221;
and before the duke could protest I was over the
battlement. I let myself down hand over hand until
I was opposite my window, but I found the bars
beyond my reach. By a supreme effort I touched
the wall with my foot and pushed myself outward,
and as I swung in I grasped one of the bars and
pulled myself to the window-ledge. I tied the end
of the rope to the bars, so that the duke could
reach them without difficulty, and then slipped into
the cell. He followed a moment later, and the
rope was loosened from above and fell. I drew
it in.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must get back to your cell at once,&#8221; I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
said, and raised the slab in the floor, slid the one
below it back and crawled aside for him to pass.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the window?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;If they find a
bar out they will know everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Leave that to me,&#8221; I answered; &#8220;I will replace
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The duke wrung my hand and dropped through
the opening into the cell below. I replaced the
slabs, concealing the rope, for which we might
have further need. Then I ran to the window
and forced the bar back into place. I opened
the box of cement, moistened it with water from
my can, and rapidly filled up the places where the
old cement had been broken away, rubbing my
fingers over it until convinced that it was quite
smooth. It was drying rapidly and would soon set.
I raised the slab again and placed the box with the
remainder of the cement beneath it. I rubbed
my hands on the floor and then over the new
cement, until I could see by the moonlight which
filtered through the bars that it was dirty as the
adamant which surrounded it. Satisfied that it
could not be detected without close examination,
I threw myself exhausted upon the bench.</p>

<p>Scarcely had I done so when I heard a noise in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
the cell below. In an instant I was at the loosened
slab.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it now?&#8221; I heard Richelieu ask, in a
sleepy voice, of some one who had evidently entered
his cell. &#8220;Upon my word,&#8221; he continued,
&#8220;&#8217;tis the regent! To what do I owe the honor of
this visit, monsieur?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You see &#8217;tis as I told Your Highness,&#8221; cried
the voice of Maison-Rouge. &#8220;The prisoners are
safe, and assuredly will not leave their cells until
I get an order permitting them to do so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are playing with me, gentlemen!&#8221; thundered
the regent, in a terrible voice. &#8220;Richelieu
was recognized not half an hour since in the gardens
of the Palais Royal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some mistake, I do not doubt,&#8221; said Richelieu,
carelessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;A mistake, <i>pardieu</i>! Perhaps it was also a
mistake that I met my daughter returning to her
apartment? Do you deny that it was with you
she had a rendezvous?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, M. le Regent, I deny nothing,&#8221; cried
Richelieu, airily. &#8220;Why should I? It is so manifestly
absurd. You say I was at the Palais Royal
a few minutes since. You rush here with all speed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
You find me asleep in my cell. All the doors are
bolted, all the drawbridges raised, every sentry at
his post. I ask you, monsieur, if the Bastille is so
easily left and entered? Besides, monsieur could
easily interrogate the sentries.&#8221;</p>

<p>The regent caught at the suggestion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maison-Rouge,&#8221; he said, &#8220;call that sentry in
the corridor.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man was called.</p>

<p>&#8220;Has any one passed since you have been on
duty?&#8221; asked the regent.</p>

<p>&#8220;No one but yourselves, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are certain?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perfectly certain, monsieur?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How long have you been on duty?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Over three hours, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here was a facer for the regent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; I heard him exclaim, suddenly, &#8220;perhaps
the other has not returned. I do not doubt
that it was he who was with Richelieu.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was back on my bench in an instant. The
door opened, and I lifted my head as from a heavy
sleep. I saw Maison-Rouge on the threshold carrying
a lantern, and back of him the regent. I was
on my feet with a bound.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>&#8220;It appears to me that your prisoners sleep with
suspicious soundness, Maison-Rouge,&#8221; said the
regent, pushing past him into the room. He
glanced about it keenly, went to the window and
shook the bars, but found nothing suspicious.</p>

<p>&#8220;How does it happen,&#8221; he asked, &#8220;that the window
here has only single bars, while those of the
floors below have double ones?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good God! what would you have, monsieur?&#8221;
cried Maison-Rouge. &#8220;Suppose there were no
bars at all, still to escape the prisoner has a drop
of ninety feet into a court-yard full of sentries,
with a wall forty feet high to pass before he is free.
A man would need wings to escape from here,
monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am beginning to think so myself,&#8221; muttered
the regent. And then, turning sharply, &#8220;So you
have been here all evening, Monsieur&mdash;I forget
your name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jean de Brancas,&#8221; I said, bowing.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you have been here all evening, have you,
M. de Brancas?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to me a useless question,&#8221; I answered.
&#8220;Monsieur forgets that I have been in the Bastille
only since yesterday afternoon.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>&#8220;What then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To consider monsieur&#8217;s question seriously
would mean that he deemed it possible for a man,
in the short space of six or eight hours, not only
to force his way out of this formidable prison, but
to force his way in again, and to leave no trace of
his passage in either direction.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right,&#8221; and the regent bit his lips.
&#8220;Come, Maison-Rouge,&#8221; he added, &#8220;let us go.
Your prisoners are doubtless anxious to resume
their slumber,&#8221; and he smiled into my eyes and
turned away.</p>

<p>They left the cell, and I heard their footsteps die
away down the corridor. A moment later Richelieu
signalled me.</p>

<p>&#8220;They discovered nothing?&#8221; he asked, as I answered
the signal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Absolutely nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how did you replace the bar in the window?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was what the cement was for.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;De Brancas, you are a genius!&#8221; exclaimed
Richelieu. &#8220;But we both need sleep. Good-night,
my friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night,&#8221; I answered, and lay down again<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
upon the bench. My eyes closed in sheer exhaustion
despite the cold, and I dreamed that I was
again walking in the Palais Royal gardens with
Louise Dacour at my side and her warm little hand
in mine.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br />


<small>AN AUDIENCE WITH THE REGENT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> sun was shining brightly through the bars
of my window when I opened my eyes. So
soundly had I slept that I had not heard the entry
of the guard, who had placed my breakfast on
the chair beside me. It consisted of a pound of
bread, which I learned afterwards was the daily
allowance for each prisoner in the Bastille, and a
plate of haricot, in which bones and turnips were
most conspicuous, and which I judged to consist
of the remains of the dinner of the previous day.
A can of water completed the repast, and I ate
without grumbling. Not knowing that the bread
was to last me the entire day, I ate it all. Then
I sat down to think over the adventures of the
night before, but I saw only the sweet face of
Louise Dacour, and my heart trembled as I
thought of the abyss I needs must span ere I
could stand beside her, an equal in rank and fortune.
Yet a stout heart might accomplish even
that.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>A tapping on the floor brought me back to
earth, and I heard Richelieu&#8217;s voice calling
me.</p>

<p>&#8220;De Brancas,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;de Brancas, tell me
that it was not all a dream.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A dream,&#8221; I answered; &#8220;then I, too, have
dreamed, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And we really did escape? We were at the
dryad fountain?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you could see my hands, monsieur, you
would not doubt it,&#8221; and I looked at them myself
with tender solicitude, for they were abraded and
blistered in many places.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes,&#8221; cried Richelieu, &#8220;it was you who
devised that plan,&mdash;who did the work. It was a
masterpiece, Jean. I shall always remember it.&#8221;</p>

<p>And he fell silent for a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;You saw her, did you not, Jean?&#8221; he asked,
suddenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I saw her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Her eyes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And are they not the most beautiful in the
kingdom?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad you think so, monsieur,&#8221; I said.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
&#8220;As for me, I have found two others which content
me admirably.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Two others?&#8221; he questioned, in an astonished
voice. &#8220;But to whom do they belong?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To Mlle. Dacour,&#8221; I answered simply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my poor friend!&#8221; exclaimed Richelieu, and
I heard him laughing. &#8220;Is your heart also in the
toils? In faith, you have my sympathy. But
come, the affair is not altogether hopeless. What
do you know of Mlle. Dacour?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing, absolutely nothing, but that she is
beautiful and smiles divinely,&#8221; I cried. &#8220;Ah, tell
me all you know!&#8221; and I hung upon every word.</p>

<p>&#8220;She was the daughter of Chevalier Louis-Armand
Dacour, who died a year ago, leaving her
an honored name, but little wherewith to support
it. Mlle. de Valois found her, it seems, admired
her, and they are now inseparable. I have heard
something more concerning her which favors your
cause,&#8221; added the duke, and he laughed again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Which favors my cause?&#8221; I asked, incredulously.</p>

<p>&#8220;She loves brave men,&#8221; said Richelieu. &#8220;She
abhors the wits and rou&eacute;s who have congregated
about the regent, and they tell many stories of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
ways in which she makes them feel her scorn.
She sighs for the days of the Great Cardinal, when
good blows were stoutly given and cheerfully
taken. Another exploit such as that of last
night, de Brancas, and, believe me, her heart is
yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, you are jesting,&#8221; I murmured. Yet
she had listened with sparkling eyes to the story
of our escape. Well, if a sword could win a way
to her heart, mine should not be idle.</p>

<p>&#8220;But come,&#8221; cried the duke, &#8220;we have talked
enough of your affairs. Let us talk of mine. Can
you guess what she has promised me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, monsieur?&#8221; I asked, with a sinking
heart, for I had little doubt as to the answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;A rendezvous for to-morrow night. Not in
the cold avenues of the garden this time, but in her
apartment in the Palais Royal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you intend to keep this rendezvous?&#8221; I
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Assuredly; why not? Did we not keep that
of yesterday?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I admitted, &#8220;but miracles do not happen
twice in the same way. However, we shall
see.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>&#8220;&#8217;Tis true about the King of Sardinia,&#8221; continued
Richelieu, in a more gloomy tone. &#8220;He
has sent proposals for her hand, and the regent
swears she shall consent. But she says she
would rather die, and I trust we may yet find
a way out of it. Ah, there is some one coming!&#8221;</p>

<p>A moment later I heard the door of his cell
opened and the voice of Maison-Rouge.</p>

<p>&#8220;The regent has just sent me an order for your
release, M. le Duc,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;My release?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Unfortunately, there is a squadron of
horse awaiting in the court-yard to convey you to
your regiment at Bayonne at once. Come, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To Bayonne? I am exiled from Paris, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So it seems.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But my friend?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are no orders for him. He must remain
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;M. de Maison-Rouge,&#8221; demanded Richelieu,
&#8220;did my friend and I keep the agreement we
made with you last night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To the letter. Better than I had hoped.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>&#8220;You may then have some feeling of friendship
for us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, monsieur?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;M. de Maison-Rouge, I ask you to go out of
that door, close it after you, and withdraw ten
paces. At the end of five minutes return and I
shall be ready to accompany you. Do this for me,
monsieur, and I shall not forget it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will not escape?&#8221; asked Maison-Rouge.
&#8220;It is not a trick?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I swear to you, monsieur, that I shall be here
when you open the door.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well; I believe I can trust you, M. le
Duc,&#8221; and I heard him withdraw and clang the
door shut after him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jean, Jean,&#8221; called Richelieu, &#8220;you heard?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, everything,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;The regent doubtless thinks I shall be safer
at Bayonne, three hundred leagues away, than in
the Bastille. Well, so be it, but nevertheless I shall
keep tryst with Charlotte to-morrow night. Listen.
Be at the dryad fountain at ten o&#8217;clock. I
will meet you there. I do not doubt Louise Dacour
will be there also.&#8221;</p>

<p>I trembled at the thought.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>&#8220;If human power can do it I will be there,&#8221; I
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;And listen, Jean,&#8221; continued Richelieu; &#8220;you
are to make my house your home if you get out of
here. You understand? Jacques will know you.
Silence. The governor is returning.&#8221;</p>

<p>A moment later his door was opened again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you ready, monsieur?&#8221; asked Maison-Rouge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite ready,&#8221; answered Richelieu, &#8220;and a
thousand thanks for your courtesy.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were gone and I was left alone with reflections
that were not too pleasant. What did
the regent intend doing with me? To a man of
Richelieu&#8217;s position some consideration must be
shown, but I might be thrown into an oubliette to
rot and no one would ask twice about me. Verily,
I thought, if I get out of this place again I shall
do my best to stay out.</p>

<p>Noon came, and with it my dinner of soup, a
piece of the meat of which it had been made, an
apple, and a bottle of wine. I had no bread, for
I had eaten all of mine for that day, and the sentry
gruffly refused to give me more. I ate the dinner
to the last morsel&mdash;for it has ever been my belief<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
that the more desperate a man&#8217;s condition the
greater his need of food&mdash;and spent the afternoon
looking out through the bars across the fields and
watching the busy highway which led towards the
city. I thought of Louise, and then with a trembling
dread of what it would mean to remain in
this accursed hole for a year or even for a month.
I vainly cudgelled my brain for a plan of escape,
but could discover none which offered even a possibility
of success. The weather had turned warm
again, for which I was thankful, for the calotte
was exposed to every wind, and must be frightfully
cold in severe weather. The allowance of wood
was limited to six pieces a day, and the wretched
stove was wholly incapable of heating the place
even with plenty of fuel.</p>

<p>The afternoon passed and evening came. I ate
the scant supper, crept into the snuggest corner,
drew my bench against me for greater warmth,
and soon fell asleep. The sun again awoke me,
and the second morning went much as the first had
done, only more wearisomely. I passed the hours
in a kind of frenzy. One thought ran ceaselessly
through my brain,&mdash;to escape&mdash;to escape&mdash;but
how? I could find no answer. About the middle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
of the afternoon I was startled by the sound of the
bolts of my door being thrown, and turned from
my window as a sentry entered.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are to follow me,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gladly,&#8221; I replied. &#8220;Nothing can be worse
than this place,&#8221; and I descended the staircase after
him. We emerged into the well court, then into
the outer court, and crossed the bridge into the
court beyond, my guard saying never a word, but
directing his steps towards the governor&#8217;s office.
A coach surrounded by a squad of mounted guards
stood before it. Maison-Rouge himself met us at
the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;M. de Brancas,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the regent has sent
for you. Enter the coach, and these gentlemen
will conduct you to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The devil!&#8221; I thought. &#8220;The regent! What
can he want?&#8221; But without permitting any of my
discomposure to appear in my face, I entered the
coach. We were soon outside the walls, and I
looked about for an opportunity to escape, but saw
none. The guards were too many; besides, they
were on horseback, while I should be on foot.
Right across the city we drove, and I looked out
upon the people passing to and fro and reflected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
bitterly that they were free and could go where
they listed. But I had little time for meditation,
for we were soon at the Palais Royal, and two of
the guards dismounting, asked me to descend from
the carriage. They placed themselves on either
side of me, and we mounted the staircase. Some
ten minutes we waited in a small antechamber to
which no one else was admitted, and then we were
shown into the presence of the regent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-day, M. de Brancas,&#8221; he said, coolly;
and added to the guards, &#8220;You may go. I fancy
I shall not need you again.&#8221; Then he turned to
me. &#8220;Now, M. de Brancas, I intend to have a
candid talk with you. But first, tell me, why are
you my enemy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I am not your enemy, monsieur,&#8221; I protested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why do you associate with my enemies?&#8221;
he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because they are my friends, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! But my police tell me that you have
been in Paris but ten days. You seem to make
friends quickly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Monsieur,&#8221; I answered, &#8220;I admit that ten
days is not a long time, but in that time M. le Duc<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
de Richelieu has twice saved my life. It will take
me much longer than ten days to repay that indebtedness.&#8221;</p>

<p>Orleans looked at me a moment, and I fancied
there was kindness in his eye. I admit the man
pleased me, for he had an engaging address and
an affable and kindly manner. I reflected that in
his youth this man had been of high courage and
ambition, and that if he had become a profligate,
it was largely the fault of the king, who had always
hated him, and of the Abb&eacute; Dubois, who had
been his preceptor. Doubtless something of my
thought appeared in my face, for the regent smiled
somewhat sadly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have heard horrible stories about me,
have you not, M. de Brancas?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;It was
I, they say, who poisoned the young Duke and
Duchess of Burgundy, who am an astrologer, an
alchemist, and an intimate friend of the devil.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, monsieur,&#8221; I stammered, &#8220;but I have
never believed such calumnies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the regent, &#8220;I do not think that any
one who knows me really believes them. Only my
enemies use them against me in order to pull me
down. But the kingdom will endure, no matter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
who assaults it. Do you believe in fate?&#8221; he asked,
abruptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Undoubtedly, monsieur,&#8221; I answered, and I
looked at him with astonished eyes.</p>

<p>He smiled as he glanced at me.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may understand, then,&#8221; he said, &#8220;why I
do not fear. For I believe that it is fate which has
committed to my hands the destinies of this kingdom.
And I intend to deserve the trust,&mdash;I intend
to make it a kingdom better worth living in.&#8221;</p>

<p>He fell silent for a moment, playing with a
paper which lay before him on the table. That he
really meant what he said&mdash;that he had in his
heart many plans for the good of the people&mdash;I do
not doubt. Ah, that he had been stronger and
turned a deaf ear to those who led him from his
purpose!</p>

<p>A tap on the door aroused him, and at his command
an usher entered.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; he asked, sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;A deputation from the King of Sardinia to see
Your Highness,&#8221; replied the man.</p>

<p>The regent&#8217;s face brightened and he straightened
up in his chair. Evidently, the delegation was
welcome.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>&#8220;Ah, about the marriage,&#8221; and I bit my lips to
repress the exclamation which would have burst
from me. &#8220;How many are in the deputation?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Three, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I will receive them here.&#8221; The usher
bowed and withdrew. &#8220;Nay, stay, M. de Brancas,&#8221;
he added to me, seeing that I made a movement
to leave the room. &#8220;This is not a state
secret, but merely a family affair, and one which I
am quite willing for all the world to know. Besides,
there may be something which I wish you
especially to hear.&#8221;</p>

<p>I felt my face crimson under his glance, whose
hidden meaning I could not doubt, but there was
no time to protest, even had I dared to do so, for
the usher was back in a moment with the deputation
at his heels. As they approached the regent I
gazed at them with astonishment, for I could have
sworn that they were livid with fear.</p>

<p>&#8220;You come from the King of Sardinia, I believe,
messieurs,&#8221; said the regent, graciously. &#8220;I
trust that he is well.&#8221;</p>

<p>The deputies bowed as one man.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is well, Your Highness,&#8221; replied one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
them, evidently the chief, &#8220;and begs to present his
respects and good wishes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thank him,&#8221; and the regent bowed in turn.
&#8220;And what message do you bring from him?&#8221;</p>

<p>I noticed that one of the men was wetting his
lips convulsively, and as he hesitated for an answer
a tapestry was raised and a man entered,
whom I knew instinctively to be Dubois. The
regent glanced at him impatiently, but said nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may remember, M. le Regent,&#8221; began the
spokesman, in a trembling voice, &#8220;that some days
ago the king sent to you a request for the hand of
your daughter, Mlle. de Valois, in marriage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I remember it very well,&#8221; said the regent, a
storm gathering on his brow as he began to suspect
some unpleasant <i>d&eacute;nouement</i>. &#8220;What then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Since that time,&#8221; continued the ambassador,
&#8220;the king has considered the matter more carefully,
and has found that he acted in haste, and
that his health will not permit this marriage. He
desires, therefore, to withdraw the request.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; cried the regent, bounding from his
chair and seeming about to fall upon the delegates,
&#8220;withdraw the request? Do you know what you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
are saying, messieurs? And what is the reason for
this extraordinary action?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have already had the honor of telling Your
Highness,&#8221; faltered the man. I did not wonder
that he had entered the room with livid face and
trembling knees.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon me,&#8221; interrupted a smooth voice, which
made me start and filled me with disgust, and the
Abb&eacute; Dubois stepped forward, &#8220;I believe I can
throw some light upon the matter. I received a moment
ago a message from my agent who has been
near the King of Sardinia, and I was about communicating
it to Your Highness when I found the
delegation here. My correspondent writes that the
king yesterday received word of a certain encounter
of the night before in the gardens of the Palais
Royal.&#8221; I colored as I felt the speaker&#8217;s eyes on
mine, but I returned his gaze without winking.
&#8220;In view of this information, he has changed his
mind about desiring to wed Mlle. de Valois.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So,&#8221; said the regent, falling into that menacing
calm which I had already seen in the Caf&eacute; Procope,
&#8220;it is Richelieu who has done this. Do you
hear, monsieur?&#8221; he continued, turning to me with
a deadly purpose in his face. &#8220;I swear that if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
Richelieu crosses my path again his head shall fall.
But,&#8221; he asked, turning suddenly to Dubois, &#8220;how
did the King of Sardinia hear of this affair so
quickly?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was in Paris,&#8221; answered Dubois. &#8220;He
came incognito a week since, for the purpose, I
think, of getting a glimpse of the princess before
asking for her hand. H&eacute;rault&#8217;s men have been
watching him for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And where is he now?&#8221; asked the regent,
eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;He left Paris at noon yesterday, monsieur,&#8221;
and I thought to myself that he had done well to
be far away before that message was delivered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said the regent, in a tone of disappointment;
and then turning to the deputation, &#8220;Messieurs,
go back to your little king and tell him that
he shall not escape chastisement. What! the ruler
of a toy island in the Mediterranean dare to insult
the regent of France? My arm is long enough to
reach him, messieurs, and my hand strong enough
to crush him. Go!&#8221;</p>

<p>The deputation hurried to the door, evidently
only too glad to escape so lightly, and at a sign
from the regent Dubois followed them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>&#8220;You have heard, M. de Brancas,&#8221; said the
regent, turning to me, his face still red with anger,
&#8220;this insult which has been put upon me, and you
understand, of course, that it is Richelieu I have
to thank for it, for I still believe that it was he and
you who were in the Palais Royal gardens. But
I am going to be generous, monsieur. You are
free. I do not believe that in your heart you are
my enemy. But keep away from plotting and intrigue,
try to find some honorable employment for
your sword, which, I have been assured, you know
how to wield, and warn Richelieu to trouble me
no more, else I will crush him as I would a fly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thank you, monsieur,&#8221; I said simply. &#8220;I
shall not forget your kindness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure of it,&#8221; said the regent, and motioned
me to go.</p>

<p>I left the palace with a light heart, and made my
way to the Hotel de Richelieu. Jacques admitted
me at once, and in a few words I told the anxious
fellow what had happened to his master, and that
he would probably return to Paris in the evening.
This done, I took a bath and donned a change of
raiment, and then sat down before a meal which
Jacques had ordered for me, and which was in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
pleasing contrast to my food of the past two days.
I glanced at the window and saw that evening was
already at hand, and as Jacques brought the candles,
I pulled my chair before the fire, with a bottle
of wine at my elbow. Louise Dacour&#8217;s sweet face
danced before me in the flames, and I wondered if
it were indeed to be my fortune to see her again
before the morning came.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br />


<small>THE CONSERVE CLOSET</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Eight</span> o&#8217;clock sounding from the Th&eacute;atins near
by brought me out of my revery. I reflected that it
would be well to employ the two hours remaining
in examining the gardens of the Palais Royal and
the building itself, in so far as possible, on the
same principle which makes the general attentively
study the field upon which he is placing his forces.
I therefore donned again the gray suit I had worn
two evenings before, and buckling a sword to my
belt, called Jacques, told him where I was going
in case Richelieu should return and ask for me,
and left the house. The weather had continued
warm and a full moon silvered the city with a
magic touch. It seemed to me that everybody was
in the streets. The Quai Malaquest was crowded,
even the steps leading down to the water and the
broad landing-places being filled with people watching
the boats dropping down the river or painfully
making way against it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>The Hotel de Mailly, just opposite the Pont
Royal, was a blaze of light, and I saw that some
f&ecirc;te was in progress. It was with difficulty that I
crossed the bridge, the press of carriages and
throng of foot passengers being so great that they
threatened at times to burst over the parapets. I
finally won across and passed before the Tuileries,
casting a glance at the entrance of Madame du
Maine&#8217;s salon, which was brilliantly lighted as ever.
Here, too, there was a great crowd, for the gardens
of the Tuileries were a popular pleasure-ground,
and in the evenings, even in severe weather, were
thronged with people who had no opportunity
during the day of drawing a breath of pure air.
The Rue St. Vincent brought me out upon the
Rue St. Honor&eacute;, the busiest street in the great
city, and down this I turned, and soon reached the
Palais Royal.</p>

<p>I was already familiar with that portion of the
building which fronted on the Rue St. Honor&eacute;,
extending in a line broken only by the great entrance
from the Rue de Richelieu to the Bons Enfants,
for I had passed it more than once in my
wanderings of the week I was alone in Paris. It
was in the gardens at the back and the buildings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
facing them that I was most concerned, for I knew
that the apartments of the regent&#8217;s daughter must
be somewhere in that part of the palace. I turned
down the Rue de Richelieu and entered the gardens
through one of the innumerable entrances
which pierced the buildings along this street. The
broad avenues of stately chestnuts were thronged
with cavaliers and ladies, sumptuously dressed,
many of them wearing masks, from which I judged
that ours were not the only love-affairs afoot.
But without pausing to more than glance at them,
I approached the palace and examined it intently.</p>

<p>At the right was a low wall enclosing a square
in which were several flower-beds, a fountain, and
an avenue of trees. This I judged to be a private
park. The buildings on either side of this small
garden had blank walls, the windows having evidently
been omitted to insure greater privacy. The
row of buildings fronting it, however, was lofty
and elegant, and built in a semi-detached fashion.
I argued that I could hardly be wrong in supposing
these to be the apartments of the members of the
regent&#8217;s family.</p>

<p>Further examination confirmed this. To the
left of the small garden was a lofty building<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
which resembled nothing so much as a soldier&#8217;s
barracks, and to the left of this again a high wall
pierced by seven gate-ways gave entrance to the
inner court, which I did not attempt to penetrate.
Still farther to the left, and counterbalancing the
space occupied by the garden at the right, was
another row of tall and ugly buildings, which I
decided were occupied by the servants of the palace
and attendants of the regent.</p>

<p>Having completed this survey, I turned my attention
to the gardens. A broad avenue of chestnuts
extended along either side. Between these
avenues were wide lawns where many flower-beds
doubtless bloomed in summer, and in the middle
of the garden was a circular pool in which was a
fountain. Farther down the avenue and near the
end of the gardens I came to the dryad fountain,
which awakened in me so sweet a memory that I
lingered by it.</p>

<p>&#8220;M. de Brancas appears to be thoughtful to-night,&#8221;
said a low, clear voice at my elbow.</p>

<p>I turned with a start and saw a masked lady
standing beside me, but the voice and the beating
of my heart told me in an instant who she
was.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>&#8220;Ah, Mlle. Dacour,&#8221; I exclaimed, bowing before
her, &#8220;shall I tell you of what I was thinking?
It was of a night not long ago when on this very
spot I met the lady whom I love and whom I am
dying to serve.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so loud, monsieur,&#8221; she commanded; &#8220;do
you not see by this mask that I wish to remain unrecognized?
Come, let us move away from here.
&#8217;Tis not yet time for the rendezvous.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would it were hours away instead of minutes,
mademoiselle,&#8221; I cried, &#8220;if it were permitted me
to walk with you here!&#8221; and I gave her my arm,
vainly endeavoring to put into words the emotion
which I felt. Perhaps she understood, for she
leaned against me lightly, and I caught the sweet,
faint perfume of her hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;M. le Duc will be here, will he not?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I trust so, mademoiselle,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;As
I suppose you know, he was released from the Bastille
yesterday and ordered to join his regiment at
Bayonne. But he assured me that he would be at
the fountain at ten o&#8217;clock to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then he will be there,&#8221; said Mlle. Dacour,
lightly. &#8220;Do you know, monsieur, I am beginning
to believe that you and Richelieu have the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
power of achieving everything upon which you
really set your hearts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would that I could believe so, mademoiselle!&#8221;
I cried. &#8220;There is one thing above all others upon
which I have set my heart. Do you believe I shall
achieve that also?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can I tell,&#8221; she answered, glancing at me
with mischievous eyes, &#8220;not knowing what this
wonderful something is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But can you not guess, mademoiselle?&#8221; I was
trembling with joy and apprehension, a trembling
which she must have felt, for she quickened her
pace.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us postpone the riddle, M. de Brancas,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;&#8217;Tis time for us to be at the fountain,&#8221;
and we turned our steps thither.</p>

<p>I dared say nothing further, for I could not
guess what was in her heart and had not the
courage to risk a rebuff. The sauntering couples
had grown less numerous as the night grew colder.
Ah, had they held in their hearts the flame of a
love like mine no stress of weather could have
driven them apart! As we approached the fountain
I saw a proud figure standing near it, which
I recognized in an instant.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>&#8220;&#8217;Tis he,&#8221; I said, and we hastened forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;In faith, I had almost given you up, de Brancas,&#8221;
cried Richelieu, gayly, as he wrung my hand
and bowed to my companion. &#8220;How did you get
out of that devil of a prison?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very easily,&#8221; I answered, &#8220;since the regent
was kind enough to open the doors for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was thoughtful of him, and I envy you
the hour you have passed with this fair lady.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, M. le Duc,&#8221; cried Mlle. Dacour, &#8220;our
conversation has been most sober, and concerned
mostly with your affairs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;De Brancas,&#8221; exclaimed the duke, &#8220;your
friendship goes too far. Forget me, I beg of you,
when you are with Mlle. Dacour. I should never
forgive myself if I thought that my petty concerns
interfered with the discussion of more appropriate
and more interesting things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how did you escape, monsieur?&#8221; I inquired.
&#8220;The regent sent a squadron of horse
with you, did he not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; answered Richelieu, airily, &#8220;but they
do not know how to ride. Last night we stopped
at Chartres. This morning we set off again at a
snail&#8217;s pace, and by noon reached Orleans, where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
we stopped for dinner. I was ashamed of the company
in which I found myself and determined to
leave it. So when the guards were in a half-somnolent
state, digesting their dinner like so many
pigs, I knocked a couple of them out of the way,
mounted my horse, and rode leisurely back to Paris
by way of Etampes and Limours. &#8217;Twas too easily
done to mention further.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the guards are doubtless on your track,
if they have not already reached Paris!&#8221; I exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose so,&#8221; said Richelieu, carelessly; &#8220;but
how can they suspect that I am here in the gardens
of the Palais Royal talking to Mlle. Dacour and
yourself, and that I am presently to see Mlle. de
Valois again? Is it not so, mademoiselle?&#8221; he
asked, turning to Louise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, M. le Duc,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;Come.
She is awaiting you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;While I have been idling here!&#8221; cried Richelieu,
and sprang forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come also, M. de Brancas,&#8221; she said, smiling
over her shoulder. &#8220;We have seen that you know
how to be of service and that you are discreet.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>I needed no second bidding.</p>

<p>A bank of clouds obscured the moon, but Mlle.
Dacour advanced without hesitation and led the
way, as I had expected, towards the right wing
of the palace with the little garden in front. A
gate in the low surrounding wall yielded to her
touch, but instead of advancing straight forward
across the garden she kept to the right in the
shadow of the buildings, where suddenly she
stopped. I looked about to discover the reason for
this, for there was an apparently solid wall beside
us, when I saw her passing her hand slowly over
it, and in a moment a section of the masonry swung
back, operated by a spring which she had pressed.</p>

<p>&#8220;What wonder is this?&#8221; asked Richelieu.</p>

<p>&#8220;No wonder at all,&#8221; replied the girl. &#8220;Simply
one of the devices arranged many years ago by
Cardinal Mazarin for purposes of his own. There
are many such in the building, if one only knows
how to find them. Enter, messieurs.&#8221;</p>

<p>We bowed our heads and entered, Mlle. Dacour
following us and closing the hidden door after her.
There was a lighted lantern standing in one corner
of the small room in which we found ourselves,
and she picked it up and motioned us to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
follow. A long, narrow passage led to the right,
and after traversing this we came to a small spiral
staircase. Up this we mounted, and found that it
ended apparently in a blank wooden wall. Along
this Mlle. Dacour felt with one hand, and as I
watched her closely, a section of the wall swung
outward. We passed through and it closed after
us. I saw with astonishment that the wall through
which we had come was covered with shelving,
filled with jars of various preserved fruits, glasses
of jelly, and boxes of sweetmeats. At that instant
Mlle. Dacour held up a warning finger and blew
out the light.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is, indeed, an unexpected honor,&#8221; I heard a
voice say, which I recognized as that of the princess.
&#8220;To what happy chance do I owe it, monsieur?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who can it be?&#8221; I heard Louise murmur, for
we seemed to have gravitated together in the dark,
and the fact that she did not resent my encircling
arm filled me with unreasonable joy and made
me bless the circumstance which held us prisoner
here.</p>

<p>&#8220;I come merely to bring you some news which
I thought might interest you,&#8221; replied a voice,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
which made me start and Louise tremble. &#8220;May
I not sit down, my dear daughter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, let us go,&#8221; whispered Louise. &#8220;&#8217;Tis
folly to remain here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, let us stay rather,&#8221; replied Richelieu in
the same tone. &#8220;I am curious to hear this news
which the regent has brought. What say you, de
Brancas?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am quite content to stay,&#8221; I answered, and I
drew Louise closer to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;As I suppose you know, mademoiselle,&#8221; the
regent&#8217;s voice was saying when the beating of my
heart permitted me to hear, &#8220;the King of Sardinia
has withdrawn his proposal for your hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It has saved him a rebuff,&#8221; answered Charlotte.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not so sure of that,&#8221; and the regent
laughed. &#8220;But do you know why he has done
this? I see from your face that you do not. It
was because of a certain rendezvous in the gardens
here, news of which had got abroad and had
reached the king&#8217;s ears. It seems I was not the
only one who saw you running towards your apartment
that night, and the others were not so discreet
as I. Do you understand now, mademoiselle?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>I heard Richelieu utter an oath and fumble for
the latch of the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;For God&#8217;s sake, keep quiet, monsieur!&#8221; I
whispered. &#8220;There may be other news.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True,&#8221; murmured Richelieu, and he stood
where he was.</p>

<p>There was a moment&#8217;s silence in the outer room,
and then the regent&#8217;s voice continued,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;But do not despair, Charlotte. I have found
you another husband. Not a king, perhaps, but of
good birth and high rank, who is also complaisant
enough to overlook your little shortcomings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And may I ask who this gentleman is?&#8221; inquired
Charlotte&#8217;s trembling voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Duc de Modena,&#8221; said the regent. &#8220;See,
he has sent his portrait in order that, by gazing at
it, you may become acquainted with your future
husband before the wedding-day arrives.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Duc de Modena!&#8221; exclaimed the girl.
&#8220;Impossible! You must be jesting, monsieur.
The Duc de Modena is old enough to be my grandfather.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I assure you that I am far from jesting, Charlotte,&#8221;
and the regent&#8217;s voice took a sterner tone.
&#8220;As for his age, he certainly bears it well. Here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
is his portrait. You can see for yourself that he is
not an uncomely man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take it away! I refuse to look at it!&#8221; she
cried, and we heard a scuffle and a crash of glass,
which betokened the destruction of the portrait.</p>

<p>Richelieu was again fumbling for the latch of
the door, swearing softly to himself, and again I
restrained him.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was a foolish act, mademoiselle,&#8221; said
the regent, &#8220;for now you will not know your husband,
even when you see him, for I swear that you
shall marry the Duc de Modena.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I swear that I shall not!&#8221; screamed Charlotte.
&#8220;I will die first!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And perhaps you wish some one else to die
first also,&#8221; continued the regent in an unchanged
voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some one else? I do not understand, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Permit me to tell you a little more of my news
and you will understand perfectly. You know,
doubtless, that yesterday I released the Duc de
Richelieu from the Bastille and sent him to join
his regiment at Bayonne?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>&#8220;Well, to-day at noon, at Orleans, he chose to
leave his escort and return to Paris.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Continue, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was not closely pursued, for his escort had
their orders. I suspected that he would do something
of the kind, and I also suspected the reason.
Do you know what I have sworn, mademoiselle?&#8221;</p>

<p>She did not answer, and there was a moment&#8217;s
pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have sworn that Richelieu&#8217;s head shall fall if
he comes in my way again. I set a very pretty
trap for him and he has walked straight into it.
In this trap you were the bait, my dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>I felt Louise trembling against me. Richelieu
was breathing deeply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, a trap,&#8221; cried the regent; &#8220;and if I mistake
not, the mice are already in it. Are there not
mice in your conserve closet, mademoiselle? I
fancied I heard a noise there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Richelieu, unable to control himself longer,
threw open the door with a crash and sprang into
the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;As you see, M. le Regent,&#8221; he cried, hoarse with
rage, &#8220;the mice are here. But I warn you that
they have sharp teeth and know how to use them.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br />


<small>THE REGENT SCORES A POINT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip of Orleans</span> was leaning back in a large
chair facing the closet in which we had been concealed,
and he did not alter his position a hair&#8217;s-breadth
as Richelieu sprang into the room with
drawn sword, I but a pace behind him. Indeed,
his face did not change a muscle, and he turned
towards us the smile he had employed with his
daughter. But the latter, recognizing her lover,
sank into a chair, her face drawn and gray with
fear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, M. le Duc,&#8221; said the regent, still smiling,
&#8220;you remained among the preserves longer than
I believed you would. You have great patience.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall never again have cause to say so,
monsieur!&#8221; cried Richelieu, white with anger, &#8220;for
I swear to you my patience is exhausted. Draw
your sword and defend yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have patience a moment longer, monsieur,&#8221;
said the regent, raising his hand. &#8220;You do not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
seem to fully understand the situation. Outside
the secret door by which you entered a dozen
of my guards are waiting, with orders to arrest
you or to kill you should you resist them. In
the antechamber there another dozen are stationed,
whom a single cry would bring to my
assistance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I should still have time to kill you, monsieur,&#8221;
cried Richelieu.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; said the regent, calmly; &#8220;but I believe,
nevertheless, that I could hold you off for
the few seconds it would require them to burst
open the door. Ah,&#8221; he continued, as though seeing
me for the first time, &#8220;here is M. de Brancas.
Good-evening, monsieur. I did not think that I
should see you again so soon. Did you give M.
le Duc the message I intrusted to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, monsieur,&#8221; I answered, and it seemed to
me that we were cutting a very poor figure in
face of the regent&#8217;s easy nonchalance.</p>

<p>&#8220;You did wrong,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It would, perhaps,
have saved him from this trap, into which he came
without knowing the danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What was this message?&#8221; asked Richelieu,
disdainfully.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>&#8220;Simply, monsieur,&#8221; answered the regent,
coolly, &#8220;that the next time I held you in my hands
I should not let you go until your head and shoulders
had parted company.&#8221;</p>

<p>A low groan from the princess made Richelieu
start.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not concern yourself, I beg of you, Charlotte,&#8221;
he cried. &#8220;These are but empty vaporings,
believe me. It seems to me that at present I am
not in this man&#8217;s power, but he in mine,&#8221; and with
a movement swift as lightning his sword was at
the regent&#8217;s breast. &#8220;If you so much as move a
muscle, monsieur,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I swear to you upon
my honor that I will drive this sword through
your heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>The regent did not move, only his smile grew
broader. I could not but admire the man.</p>

<p>&#8220;De Brancas,&#8221; cried Richelieu, &#8220;bind your
scarf tightly over his mouth. Do not lift your
hand, monsieur,&#8221; he continued warningly to the
regent.</p>

<p>I did as he bade me, marvelling that Orleans did
not show more spirit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now off with his hat and cloak,&#8221; continued
Richelieu.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>I obeyed, and still the regent made no sign. I
began to fear some further trap.</p>

<p>&#8220;What now, monsieur?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;In faith, I do not know,&#8221; said Richelieu. &#8220;I
might, indeed, don the cloak and hat, go out and
order the guard away so that we could escape, but
if we both leave, who will guard the regent? We
might tie him, but it must needs be most securely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go, go, monsieur!&#8221; I cried, seizing his sword,
but still keeping the point at the regent&#8217;s breast.
&#8220;Put on the cloak and hat and go. I will stay,
and I answer for it he will make no outcry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Impossible,&#8221; said Richelieu. &#8220;I go and leave
you, my friend?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;It is not with me a
matter of life and death. Besides, with my sword
at his heart I shall be able to make my own terms.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True,&#8221; said Richelieu, but he still hesitated and
turned towards Mlle. de Valois.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Charlotte,&#8221; he said, dropping on one knee
before her and lifting her hand to his lips, &#8220;it
seems that I am never to be permitted to tell you
how I love you. But what is this?&#8221; he cried, looking
up into her eyes to find them closed. &#8220;Oh,
what has happened?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>Mlle. Dacour hastened to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;She has merely fainted, M. le Duc,&#8221; she said
after a moment. &#8220;It is nothing. She will soon
be herself again, I answer for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank God!&#8221; exclaimed the duke, and he covered
with kisses the hand he held in his own. &#8220;I
cannot go leaving her so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I implore you to go, monsieur!&#8221; I entreated.
&#8220;We do not know what instructions have been
given the guards at the door. They may break in
at any moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I yield,&#8221; murmured Richelieu, and he picked
up the regent&#8217;s cloak and wrapped it about him;
&#8220;but this is the last time that I will run away.
I shall take horse for Bayonne,&#8221; he continued.
&#8220;With my regiment I shall be safe. They would
go to hell for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>But I looked at him gloomily, for I saw that even
in that disguise his lithe, upright figure bore little
resemblance to the shorter and stouter form of the
regent.</p>

<p>&#8220;I fear the guards will suspect you, monsieur,&#8221;
I said. &#8220;The disguise is a poor one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So be it!&#8221; cried the duke, flinging the cloak
and hat from him and picking up his own. &#8220;I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
will go without disguise, and trust to my sword
to win me passage.&#8221; He placed his hand at his
side, and remembered that I had his sword pressed
against the regent&#8217;s heart. I drew my own with
my other hand, and presenting it to the prisoner&#8217;s
throat, handed Richelieu his own.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, wait a moment, M. le Duc,&#8221; cried Mlle.
Dacour, as he started towards the door; &#8220;there
is another way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And unguarded?&#8221; he asked, pausing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe so. Come,&#8221; and she led the way towards
the apartment in the rear of that in which
we were.</p>

<p>&#8220;Adieu, de Brancas,&#8221; said Richelieu, pausing
on the threshold. &#8220;If you suffer for this I will
bring all Brittany to your rescue,&#8221; and he was
gone.</p>

<p>I glanced at Orleans, but he made no sign.
What new trap was he preparing that he should
sit here so contentedly? I strained my ears for
the clash of arms or for any outcry which would
tell of the discovery of the fugitive, but none came.
The moments passed.</p>

<p>&#8220;He must be safe by this time,&#8221; I murmured.</p>

<p>&#8220;That being the case, let us put an end to this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
farce,&#8221; said the regent, speaking quite distinctly
through the scarf which encircled his head, and
putting up his hand, he tore the scarf away. My
sword quivered in my hand, yet I had never killed
a man but in fair fight and my heart failed me
now. &#8220;Come, M. de Brancas,&#8221; he continued,
calmly, reading my thought in my face, &#8220;put down
your sword. Did you think that I should have sat
quiet here so obligingly had I desired to detain
the duke? Surely, you gave me credit for more
spirit, monsieur?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then there was a trap?&#8221; I stammered, though
not surprised at this confirmation of my suspicions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, not precisely,&#8221; and the regent smiled.
&#8220;But here is Mlle. Dacour, who may have some
news for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She entered as he spoke and cast an alarmed and
astonished glance at my lowered sword and the
regent&#8217;s smiling face.</p>

<p>&#8220;The duke is safe, is he not?&#8221; I cried, alarmed
in my turn.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe so,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;I let him out
by the little door into the Rue de Richelieu. There
was no guard at the door and apparently we were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
unobserved. I watched him until he turned into
the Rue St. Honor&eacute; and mingled with the crowd.
Then I closed the door and returned.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; said Orleans, rising, &#8220;you see that
your friend is safe, de Brancas, and that you have
again outwitted me. Make your adieux to Mlle.
Dacour and leave her to attend to my daughter.
Come with me. I have two words to say to you,&#8221;
and he picked up his hat and cloak and walked
towards the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, what does he mean?&#8221; whispered Louise,
clutching at my sleeve, her eyes dark with terror.
&#8220;Does he mean to do you harm, Jean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That one word would repay me for it all,&#8221; I
said, looking down with infinite love into that
sweet, upturned face. &#8220;But I do not think so,
Louise. In faith, I believe it is he who has outwitted
us this evening, and not we who have outwitted
him. But, oh, my life,&#8221; I whispered, pressing
her to me, &#8220;you care a little, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go, go!&#8221; she said, pushing me towards the
door. &#8220;Do not keep him waiting. Do not make
him angry, if he be not already so,&#8221; and she gave
me one glance that made my heart leap and closed
the door upon me. Something of my joy must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
have appeared in my face, for the regent, who
was standing just outside, looked at me and smiled
quizzically, but said nothing. I glanced about
with astonishment, for there was not a single guard
in sight.</p>

<p>He noticed my glance and smiled yet more
broadly, but still kept silence. Motioning me to
follow him, he led the way to the same room where
he had given me audience but a few hours before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down, M. de Brancas,&#8221; he said, throwing
himself into the large chair which he had occupied
in the afternoon. &#8220;Do you know,&#8221; he continued,
looking at me with a smile, &#8220;I greatly enjoy adventures
such as that of this evening. They give
tone to the nerves and prove that not all men are
cowards. In times of peace, such as these, it is
often difficult to decide who is brave and who is
not. In faith, if our treasury were not so depleted
I believe I would risk a little war just for the pleasure
of settling the question in regard to a few people
about whom I am undecided. I already know
where to place you, monsieur,&#8221; and I reddened at
the compliment. &#8220;But,&#8221; he continued, and he
changed his tone suddenly, &#8220;I dare say you and
Richelieu believed you were executing a very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
clever little coup this evening. You reminded me
of nothing so much as of that ridiculous Sganerelle
in M. Moli&egrave;re&#8217;s &#8216;L&#8217;&Eacute;cole des Maris,&#8217; who while
opposing his adversary with all his might in reality
plays into his hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I confess, M. le Duc,&#8221; I said, &#8220;that I am still
somewhat in the dark.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt,&#8221; he laughed. &#8220;Come, I will lay the
cards on the table for the sheer pleasure of looking
at them myself. Did you really believe me so
anxious to deprive Richelieu of his head?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You certainly seemed violent enough, monsieur,&#8221;
I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, well, and I should have kept my word
under certain conditions. But I am not of a
blood-thirsty humor, and all I desired was to get
Richelieu out of the way because he interferes
with certain of my plans, as you know. Now, at
Bayonne he will be quite as powerless to interfere
with me as in the grave. Three hundred leagues
is a long distance, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, ah!&#8221; I cried, a light beginning to break in
upon me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; continued the regent, &#8220;I knew very
well that he would attempt to regain Paris, for I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
suspected to-night&#8217;s rendezvous, monsieur, as I
suspect a great many other things,&#8221; and he glanced
at me in a way which made me wonder if the Cellamare
conspiracy was really such a profound secret
as the conspirators believed. &#8220;Consequently I
gave orders to his guards not to press him too
closely should he attempt to escape, and I prepared
a trap for him here. He was followed from
the moment he entered Paris until he disappeared
through M. de Mazarin&#8217;s private entrance below
there. You do not seem to recognize the fact that
I have a well-organized police department, monsieur,
the best that the world has ever seen. I had
resolved this: If Richelieu could escape from this
trap and set out for Bayonne as I expected, I
should make no great resistance. If he could not
escape, he should die.&#8221;</p>

<p>The last words were uttered in a voice that
chilled me.</p>

<p>&#8220;As you may guess,&#8221; continued the regent, &#8220;I
was not sorry when he carried out his plan of escape,
for I believe that now he will really go to
Bayonne, and he cannot return from there in time
to interfere with me. He is a popular and powerful
man, and while I should not have hesitated in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
sending him to the block, it would have made me
new enemies, whom I could ill afford just at this
time. Have you ever known what it is, M. de
Brancas,&#8221; he asked, suddenly, &#8220;to be hooted and
stoned through the streets?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, monsieur,&#8221; I answered, surprised at the
turn the conversation had taken and at the gloomy
cloud which had descended upon the regent&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have known what it is!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;I,
regent of France,&mdash;king in everything but name.
I have been abominated, hissed, spat upon. Even
now I am suspected, and Villeroi, the king&#8217;s governor,
surrounds him with ridiculous precautions
to keep me away from him. I am trying to turn
the tide the other way; I am trying to make
friends, hence I am lenient with you and with
Richelieu. I do not know why I am telling you
this,&#8221; he added in another tone, &#8220;only I admire
brave men, whether they are with me or against
me. That is all; forget this conversation and keep
Richelieu from vexing me too far. You may go.&#8221;</p>

<p>I bowed and left the room with a dazed consciousness
that I had seen a side of the man which
the world knew little of, and as I threaded my
way through the corridors and down the great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
staircase to the street I pondered upon it wonderingly.
When I heard, afterwards, as I often did,
of the excesses of the little suppers which he gave
nearly every night in his apartment, I did not
find it in my heart to blame him.</p>

<p>The increasing cold and the lateness of the hour
had driven the people from the streets, and even
the Rue St. Honor&eacute; was almost deserted as I
emerged from the Palais Royal. I returned as I
had come, casting a glance at the gloomy river as
I crossed it, and was soon at the Hotel de Richelieu.
Jacques admitted me, and told me that his master
had secured a horse from the stables more than an
hour before and was now well on the road to
Bayonne.</p>

<p>I was glad to learn that Richelieu had indeed
left Paris, for I had little hope that the regent
would permit reasons of state to interfere with
his personal inclinations should the duke provoke
him further. Nor, indeed, had I much hope that
Richelieu would remain at Bayonne, despite his
knowledge of the regent&#8217;s purpose. Philip of Orleans
was still in my mind as I went to bed, and
as I dropped asleep I was compelled to admit that
he was a greater man than I had thought.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br />


<small>THE HOUSE IN THE RUE VILLEDOT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris</span>, with its ever-changing crowds, its narrow,
clamorous streets, its towering, tottering,
dingy buildings, its contrasts of wealth and
poverty, light and shade, had not yet ceased to
astonish me. It was a wonderful place,&mdash;wonderful,
at least, to me, who had known only Poitiers,&mdash;and
I, who had sat in the chimney corner at
home with mouth agape listening to the tales my
grandfather&mdash;God rest his soul&mdash;was wont to tell
of it, had during the first few days hastened from
place to place,&mdash;from Notre Dame to the Place de
Greve, from the Porte St. Denis to the Great
Chatelet,&mdash;constructing anew the scenes which had
made them all so famous, and delighted to find
that they had remained unchanged with the
changing years. For half a century the city had
stood stagnant, the king choosing to lavish his
money on his wars or his pleasures rather than in
beautifying his capital, or sinking into his grave,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
his coffers empty, his subjects estranged, under
the severe dominion of Madame de Maintenon.
But I found it beautiful, and in the romance with
which I clothed it forgot the uneven streets, the
stenches of the ill-kept gutters, the danger from
the tottering walls. It was to me a dream city,
and, as in dreams, I used only one faculty in
regarding it,&mdash;the imagination.</p>

<p>I awoke with its uproar in my ears, and gazed
with interest from my window at the hurrying torrent
of carriages and vehicles of every kind which
filled the street from side to side and constantly
threatened to engulf and overwhelm the foot passengers,
hurled hither and thither by the ceaseless
crush. I watched with apprehension the attempts
of a pretty woman to cross the crowded roadway,
and breathed a sigh of relief when I saw her safely
over. A tap at the door brought me from the window,
and I opened it to find Jacques bowing on the
threshold.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-morning, monsieur,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Is there
anything you wish?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing but breakfast, my dear Jacques,&#8221; I
answered, heartily, for I had taken a liking to his
pleasant face and admired the unquestioning way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
in which he carried out his master&#8217;s orders. &#8220;It
will be served soon, I trust.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is awaiting monsieur,&#8221; he said, and he led
the way to the lower floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you heard anything further from Richelieu?&#8221;
I asked, when I had seated myself at the
table and he was stationed behind my chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only a message from him this morning, asking
if monsieur had arrived home safely, and stating
that he himself had reached Limours without misadventure
and would be at Blois to-night, where
he would consider his future course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pray heaven that it take him on to Bayonne!&#8221;
I said, fervently. &#8220;He is better away from Paris
for a time.&#8221; But I had little hope that he would
think of caution. &#8220;If you send a message to him,&#8221;
I added, &#8220;tell him that I am quite safe and that he
need have no concern on my account.&#8221; Yet I knew
very well that it was not I but Mlle. de Valois
who would bring him back to Paris.</p>

<p>The day was bright and warm and I left the
house with a light heart. I reflected that I could
do nothing better than call at the salon of Madame
du Maine and renew my offer of service, but the
day was not yet far advanced, and I lingered upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
the quays, where a thousand noises mingled in one
indescribable uproar which fascinated me. Boats
were discharging their cargoes at the landing-places,
a row of boys sat upon the piers fishing,
the crowd eddied ceaselessly back and forth, and
above all the din arose the cries of the street venders
of vegetables, fruit, fish, milk, and I know
not what, for their incomprehensible jargon, which
I vainly endeavored to understand, gave me no clue
to the wares they were selling. At every step there
was a beggar, a blind man, or a street musician.
The water-carriers, of whom I was told there were
not less than twenty thousand in Paris, carried
bells, which they rang with an ardor nothing
seemed to diminish. Here was a woman selling
oysters, which she carried in a huge hamper on
her back; another was bent almost double under
a great bundle of brooms; a third was selling
flowers, which were displayed on a broad shallow
basket strapped to her hips. Men were crying the
most impossible things,&mdash;toy windmills, boot-laces,
buckets, bellows, prints, and even rat-traps. Here
was a tinker, carrying with him his fire of charcoal,
his anvil, and all his tools; there a cobbler, who
was sitting against the wall, in a corner out of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
harm&#8217;s way, mending a shoe. One fellow with a
loud voice and a very red face endeavored to sell
me a ticket in some lottery, and another offered
me a bottle of magic ink, which would fade after
a certain time and leave no trace behind it. He
told me it was of especial value and in great demand
for love-letters, since, after the second day,
the writing would entirely disappear and so compromise
no one. I laughed at him, and told him I
had no use for his ink, since I had never in my life
written a love-letter, whereat he showed me, with a
great air of mystery, a wizard&#8217;s ring, which he was
willing to part with for a pistole, and which he
assured me would win me the love of any woman
whose hand I might touch while I wore it. I inquired
why it was that he was willing to sell so
great a treasure, and he answered that it had made
his life a burden to him, so closely and constantly
was he pursued by the women who had fallen victims
to the talisman. A crowd had gathered
around us as we talked, and when I turned away,
still laughing, he appealed to other of the listeners,
and I doubt not managed to strike a bargain with
one of them. I did not wait to see the conclusion
of the matter, but struggled through the crowd,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
and with considerable effort gained the other side
of the river, where I finally paused to take breath
in the Rue des Poulies.</p>

<p>Nothing had astonished me so much in Paris as
the height of the buildings, and I looked with interest
at those about me. They straggled into the
air six, seven, or eight stories, as though each successive
generation, prohibited by the royal edict
from building without the walls, had at last found
a home by adding an extra story to the ancestral
domiciles. The flood of houses, which had long
before overwhelmed the walls of the old city, was
fast piling up within the new walls as within a
great reservoir, and another inundation of the surrounding
country could not be far distant. Each
house had its sign, projecting far into the street,
and from every story protruded a spout, which,
in rainy weather, precipitated torrents of dirty
water upon the passers-by. The fronts of the
houses were for the most part of wood and plaster
and, where not concealed by bills, indescribably
dirty. Many of them seemed on the point of falling
down, and were saved from that fate only by
leaning against their more fortunate neighbors.
Bills and flaring posters were everywhere, bearing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
some piece of political satire or morsel of scandalous
gossip.</p>

<p>I turned into the Rue St. Honor&eacute;, and was soon
again in the midst of a tumult as great as that upon
the quays, only here the crowd was more fashionable,
and there were in consequence more beggars.
I knew no one in it, so, unconsciously catching the
spirit of the place, I hurried on past the Palais
Royal, at which I cast a lingering glance, wondering
if it would ever be my good fortune to join the
throng of gayly dressed courtiers and enter boldly
with them. Turning down the Rue St. Louis, I
soon gained the Tuileries. The entrance to that
portion of the palace, the Pavilion Marsan, occupied
by Madame du Maine was almost deserted,
but a lacquey who was lounging in the vestibule
took in my name, and, returning in a moment, informed
me that I was to enter. He led me to a
small room at the left, where I found the duchess
and Mlle. de Launay together, busily occupied in
examining a vast number of formidable-looking
papers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Enter, M. de Brancas,&#8221; cried the duchess, seeing
me pause upon the threshold. &#8220;You are not
intruding. In fact, you come most fortunately and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
just at the moment when Mlle. de Launay and I
were wishing for some one like yourself, who could
be trusted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, madame,&#8221; I said. &#8220;I shall try
to merit your trust,&#8221; and I entered and bowed to
both the ladies. &#8220;I had scarcely expected to find
you at work so early.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! it seems to me that we never have time
for repose,&#8221; exclaimed the duchess. &#8220;There is
so much to be done and so few whom I can
trust to do it. But tell me, monsieur, what has
become of Richelieu? I have not seen him for an
age.&#8221;</p>

<p>I related briefly the adventures of the duke and
myself, taking care to say nothing of my last conversation
with the regent, and adding that as
Richelieu was <i>en route</i> for Bayonne, I believed it
best for him to remain there for a time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the duchess, thoughtfully, when I
had finished, &#8220;I believe so myself. The match will
soon be applied here, and then he would have to be
at Bayonne in any case. But this morning, M. de
Brancas, I wish to ask your company for Mlle.
de Launay, who has an errand to do which will not
permit the use of a carriage and who finds it impossible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
to thread these crowded streets without
an escort.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be only too happy to be of service,&#8221;
I answered, and at a sign from the duchess her
companion withdrew to make ready for the
street.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can judge to what straits we are reduced,
monsieur,&#8221; continued madame, with a note of sadness
and discouragement in her voice, the first I
had ever heard there, &#8220;when I tell you that Mlle.
de Launay is the only one there is to whom I can
intrust missions which require a certain courage
and finesse. There are many, it is true, who offer
their services, but none upon whom I can rely as
upon this girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>I could think of nothing to say that would not
be mere banality, and as she busied herself carefully
tying up a bundle of papers, I looked at her
more attentively. I was not surprised to find her
face pale and careworn, and I did not doubt that
she was passing sleepless nights and harassing days
in the endeavor to get all the threads of this conspiracy
straightened out and properly arranged,&mdash;that
she worked while others merely talked.
Mlle. de Launay soon returned, and the duchess<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
handed her the packet of papers which I had seen
her arrange.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will find all the needed information
there,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and remember that you cannot
urge too strongly the need of haste. Every moment
I fear that something will happen to render
all our work useless. There, hasten,&#8221; she continued,
dismissing us with a gesture, &#8220;and do not
keep me waiting longer than necessary for your
report.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We will not make ourselves unnecessarily conspicuous,
monsieur,&#8221; said my companion, as we left
the room, and she led the way along a wide hall
running to the rear of the building. We descended
into a small court, bounded on one side by a high
wall and on the other by a row of buildings, and
passed across this to a gate in the wall at the end.
She opened the gate with a key she took from her
pocket, and locked it after us. We found ourselves
in a narrow little street which opened into the Rue
de l&#8217;Echelle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our mission is, then, a secret one?&#8221; I asked,
as we entered this street.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not just that,&#8221; answered the girl, smiling
at me, &#8220;and yet it is well to be cautious. We are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
going to see a gentleman who lives in the Rue
Villedot. I have been there many times. But there
are always a dozen police spies hanging about the
entrance to the Tuileries, and I avoid them when
I can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mademoiselle,&#8221; I asked, suddenly, &#8220;the police
department is well organized, is it not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Splendidly,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;This man, H&eacute;rault,
who is at the head of it, has a genius for the
work, and no one is safe from him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think, then,&#8221; I continued, &#8220;that the
plans of Madame du Maine are altogether unknown
to him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can only hope so,&#8221; she said, and her face
grew lined with anxiety. &#8220;Yet, even if he did
suspect, that would not be enough. He cannot
know the details of our plans, and without something
more definite than suspicion even the regent
would not dare raise his hand against a princess of
the blood. We are hurrying our preparations forward
as rapidly as we can, and hope to be the ones
to strike the first blow. Everything depends upon
that,&#8221; she added. &#8220;We have gone too far and
the end is now too near to turn back, monsieur,
or we might, perhaps, await a better time.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>&#8220;But success,&mdash;can you win success?&#8221; I persisted.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is certain,&#8221; and her face was alight with
enthusiasm, &#8220;provided only we are undisturbed
a single week longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>We had again reached the busy portion of the
city, and the uproar drowned our voices. Besides,
I had sufficient to think about in protecting my
companion from the crowd of passing carriages.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must hasten,&#8221; she cried, suddenly, &#8220;or
we shall be caught in the rain.&#8221;</p>

<p>I glanced at the sky and saw that she was right,
for a bank of clouds from which came rumblings
of distant thunder was every moment growing
more threatening. We turned hurriedly down the
Rue des Frondeurs, and in a moment had plunged
into one of the irregular and squalid quarters of
the city. But the girl went forward without hesitation
and as though well acquainted with the
road. We passed through a maze of short streets
running in all directions, apparently at haphazard,
and suddenly my companion paused at a corner
house.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the place,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The man I
have come to see lives on the second floor. That<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
is his window you see up there. Do you await
me here, M. de Brancas. I will be back in a moment,&#8221;
and without waiting for me to answer, she
plunged into the dark and narrow entrance.</p>

<p>I glanced up and down the street apprehensively,
for her statement as to the efficiency of the police
department, added to my own vague fears, had
filled me with alarm, but we were seemingly unobserved.
A crowd of poorly dressed people was
passing in either direction, and a rabble of children
was playing in the gutter in the middle of the
street, but no one paused to cast a second glance
at me. The darkened sky had thrown the street
into a gloom which rendered the sagging houses
threatening and terrible, an effect which an occasional
flash of lightning served to heighten. The
moments passed, and I paced impatiently up and
down before the door, wondering what had detained
the girl. I had just determined to mount
the stairs and find out for myself when I heard a
crash of glass above me and a scream for help in
a woman&#8217;s voice, which I recognized only too
plainly.</p>

<p>In an instant I was through the doorway and
stumbling up the dirty staircase with drawn sword,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
cursing the darkness which delayed my progress,
I arrived at the first landing and paused a moment
to listen, but heard nothing. I reflected that
the window she had shown me was on the floor
above, and mounted cautiously, not knowing what
the danger might be towards which I was advancing.
Again I paused to listen, but still heard
nothing. I strained my ears, and in a moment
fancied I heard a moan. I felt before me and
found a door. I applied my ear to the keyhole and
heard a second moan, which could not this time
be mistaken. With a bound I flung my body
against the door. It gave way with a crash and
I was precipitated into the room beyond. By an
effort I kept my feet, and at a glance I saw in one
corner a man bending over the prostrate form of
my companion.</p>

<p>He turned a startled face towards me as I entered
and half started to rise, but I was upon him
ere he could draw his weapon, and ran him
through by the mere force of my onslaught. He
fell like a log, but at the moment I turned to the
prostrate girl I heard hurrying feet upon the stair
without, and I sprang towards the door, my sword
gleaming red in my hand, to meet this new danger.</p>

<small>A CONFERENCE WITH CELLAMARE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;What</span> have we here?&#8221; cried a voice from the
staircase. I could perceive no one because of the
darkness, but I knew from the accent that the
speaker was not a Frenchman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Enter, monsieur,&#8221; I said, realizing that I could
do nothing against an antagonist who remained
invisible. &#8220;Enter, and we shall doubtless be able
to arrive at an explanation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, ah!&#8221; cried the voice again, &#8220;but I do not
know you, monsieur. Stay; do not move,&#8221; he
continued, as I advanced a step towards the door.
&#8220;I have you covered with two pistols, and I desire
you to remain where you are for the present. I
might miss with one, but I should surely kill you
with the other. Now, pray tell me what you are
doing in this room.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard a lady cry out in distress,&#8221; I answered,
reflecting rapidly that the statement of this simple
fact could compromise no one and that it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
necessary to gain time. &#8220;I ran up the stairs,
broke open the door, and cut down a scoundrel
whom I found choking her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And where is this lady, may I ask?&#8221; inquired
the voice in an anxious tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the corner there, and I doubt not in great
need of attention. But I am growing weary of
this questioning, monsieur,&#8221; and I made another
step towards the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;One question more,&#8221; said the man. &#8220;Did you
accompany the lady hither?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I answered, without hesitation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then everything is as it should be,&#8221; he cried,
&#8220;and you have rendered me a great service.
Come, put down your sword as I put up my pistols.
It was I whom the lady came to see. You
will believe this when I tell you that she is Mlle.
de Launay and that she comes from Madame du
Maine,&#8221; and as he spoke he entered the room,
his pistols in his belt. I saw him to be a man between
fifty and sixty years of age, with a soldierly
carriage and haughty bearing which the dark cloak
he wore could not conceal. I was not surprised,
therefore, when he threw off his cloak and disclosed
beneath it a handsome cavalier&#8217;s dress. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
moustache, which described a straight line across
his upper lip, was slightly tinged with gray, and
from the darkness of his skin and the fire in his
eyes I judged him to be a Spaniard or Italian.</p>

<p>&#8220;The devil,&#8221; I thought, &#8220;have I stumbled into
another love-affair? It seems to me that I have
enough on my hands already,&#8221; but I continued
my survey of the new-comer without saying a
word.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, monsieur,&#8221; he said, with a smile, &#8220;it
is evident that you do not know me. Before I can
tell you who I am I must ask you one other question.
You are, perhaps, acquainted with certain
plans of Madame du Maine?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you were aware that Mlle. de Launay
was to leave some papers here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you did not know for whom the papers
were intended,&mdash;is it not so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is so, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I will tell you for whom they were intended.
They were intended for Antonio Giudice,
Duke of Giovennazzo and Prince of Cellamare,
ambassador of Spain at the court of Versailles. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
other words, monsieur, they were intended for
myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>I had for a moment suspected what was coming,
and it needed no second glance to tell me that he
was speaking the truth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, M. le Prince,&#8221; I cried, sending my sword
into its sheath, &#8220;I am indeed glad to see you!
But who, then, was the fellow whom I cut
down?&#8221;</p>

<p>Cellamare bent over the man and looked into
his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis a servant of mine!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;He
came to me with excellent recommendations a
month ago and I employed him. I sent him on
here to inform mademoiselle that I should be a few
moments late.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Doubtless a police spy, then,&#8221; I said. &#8220;He is
not dead, and perhaps we may get something more
out of him. But come, let us close the door and
see what injury has been done her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cellamare sprang to the door and soon had it
in place again, while I kneeled beside her body and
placed my hand above her heart. I was overjoyed
to feel it still faintly beating. Stooping closer, I
saw that she was unconscious, and some livid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
marks about her neck indicated that the brute had
been choking her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; I said, &#8220;I believe that she has only
fainted. Could you procure some water and some
wine, monsieur?&#8221;</p>

<p>Cellamare went into an adjoining room, and in
a moment returned with a glass of water and a
bottle of wine. I dipped my handkerchief in the
water and bathed her face. In a moment she
opened her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, that is better,&#8221; I said, supporting her
head with my arm. &#8220;Now drink some of this,
mademoiselle,&#8221; and I filled a second glass with
wine and held it to her lips. Mechanically she
swallowed it, and I saw the color returning to her
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, what has happened?&#8221; she whispered.
&#8220;Where am I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite safe, I assure you, mademoiselle,&#8221; answered
Cellamare, and between us we assisted her
to her feet.</p>

<p>She looked at him a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes, I recollect,&#8221; she cried, suddenly. &#8220;I
was bringing you the papers. Where are the
papers?&#8221; and her hands flew to her waist in an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
agony of apprehension, which I fully shared.
&#8220;They are safe,&#8221; she said, and she drew from
the folds of her dress the packet of papers
which I had seen Madame du Maine give her.
&#8220;Take them, M. le Prince,&#8221; she added, handing
them to him, &#8220;and now tell me what has
happened.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you tell us first what happened to you,
mademoiselle,&#8221; I suggested, &#8220;then we can better
understand the story.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said, quickly, &#8220;when I left M. de
Brancas at the foot of the stairs,&#8221; Cellamare bowed
to me as she mentioned my name, &#8220;I ran quickly
up and knocked at the door of this room. A man
whom I did not know opened it. He said he had
been sent to meet me by M. de Cellamare. He
told me to enter, and closed the door behind me.
He continued that M. de Cellamare would not be
able to keep the appointment, and that I was to
leave any papers I might have for him and he
would get them later in the day. Something in
the man&#8217;s manner frightened me, and I replied
that I should not leave the papers, but would make
another appointment with M. le Prince. I started
to leave the room, when he sprang upon me. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
threw him off and rushed to the window, broke it,
and screamed for help, hoping that M. de Brancas
would hear me. At that instant I felt strong
fingers on my throat and knew no more.&#8221;</p>

<p>I related briefly my share in the adventure, and
Cellamare repeated what he had already told me
in reference to the stranger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps he can tell us something more,&#8221; I
suggested, as Cellamare concluded, and I dragged
the prostrate man to the wall and propped him
against it. He groaned as I did so. &#8220;Ah, come,&#8221;
I said, &#8220;he is not dead yet. Let us see where my
sword went through him.&#8221; I stripped his doublet
from his shoulder and found the blood welling
from a wound which had undoubtedly pierced his
breast, but which was yet some distance above
his heart. &#8220;This will not kill him if his blood
be good,&#8221; I remarked, and bathed the wound with
my wet handkerchief. The bleeding slowly ceased
and I tied the fellow&#8217;s scarf tightly over it. &#8220;Let
us see, now, if we cannot bring him to consciousness,&#8221;
and prying his teeth apart, I forced a little
wine between his lips. He groaned again, and
this time opened his eyes. He seemed to comprehend
at once where he was, for he glanced from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
me to Cellamare and back again, and grew even
more livid, if such a thing were possible.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not fear,&#8221; I said, &#8220;we are not going to
harm you further, and you will soon get well of
this little wound if you are properly cared for.
Now we will care for you, but only on one condition.&#8221;</p>

<p>His eyes questioned me.</p>

<p>&#8220;The condition is,&#8221; I continued, answering
their glance, &#8220;that you tell us for whom you
wished to secure these papers. Do you agree?&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at me again and then at Cellamare,
but there was no relenting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he whispered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then who sent you here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&eacute;rault.&#8221; We all started at the word, for if
H&eacute;rault suspected, there was no telling what might
happen.</p>

<p>&#8220;He told you to enter the employ of M. de Cellamare?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And provided you with recommendations?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For what purpose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To watch him.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>&#8220;But why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know. I was to obtain possession, if
I could, of any papers or correspondence he might
receive from Madame du Maine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again we exchanged a glance.</p>

<p>&#8220;And H&eacute;rault told you that these papers might
be brought by Mlle. de Launay?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What were you to do with the papers when
you had once obtained them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was to leave them at a certain place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>

<p>The fellow hesitated, but a glance at our faces
told him that we would take no equivocation.</p>

<p>&#8220;With the concierge of the house at the corner
of the Rue Jean St. Denis and the Rue de Beauvais,&#8221;
he answered, at last.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you taken any papers there as yet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. This afternoon was the first chance I
had to get any.&#8221;</p>

<p>I paused to consider.</p>

<p>&#8220;This man can tell us nothing further,&#8221; I said,
after a moment. &#8220;Let us put him out of the way
for a time.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>&#8220;There is a bed in the next room,&#8221; said Cellamare.</p>

<p>We lifted him as gently as we could and laid
him on the bed. Then we returned to the larger
room and carefully closed the door between the
two.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to me that we are lost,&#8221; and Cellamare
threw himself into a chair, his face dark
with disappointment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, do not say so, monsieur!&#8221; and Mlle. de
Launay, who had been a silent spectator of the
foregoing scene, wrung her hands in anguish.</p>

<p>&#8220;But if H&eacute;rault knows,&#8221; protested the prince.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps he does not know,&#8221; I answered.
&#8220;Perhaps he only suspects, without knowing exactly
what to suspect. He has doubtless observed
that many couriers have passed between the Spanish
embassy and the court of Madrid. He has,
perhaps, been told that Madame du Maine and
M. de Cellamare exchange many communications.
He suspects something, he knows not what, and he
is trying to find out more. This in itself would
not be very serious. Only,&#8221; I added, &#8220;we must
prevent his finding out anything more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may be right, monsieur,&#8221; and Cellamare&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
face brightened a little. &#8220;But to prevent his finding
out anything more,&mdash;that will be a difficult
task.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He must be thrown on the wrong scent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You heard what disposition was to be made of
the papers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, to-night a package of papers will be left
for M. H&eacute;rault at this house in the Rue de Beauvais.
They will be papers from Madame du Maine
to yourself. Only, they will have no connection
with this enterprise, but with something quite different.
In a word, they will be papers prepared
expressly for the eye of M. H&eacute;rault. You understand?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perfectly,&#8221; and Cellamare&#8217;s eyes sparkled with
their old brilliancy. &#8220;The plan is admirable,
monsieur; permit me to compliment you.&#8221;</p>

<p>I bowed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps monsieur could suggest some subject
upon which correspondence would be necessary,
and which would yet not have the air of a conspiracy,&#8221;
I continued.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have it!&#8221; cried Mlle. de Launay. &#8220;Let us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
prepare a lot of petitions, papers, and memorials
praying the King of Spain to intercede with the
regent to annul the decree which shuts the Duke
du Maine from the throne. This would be a subject
requiring no little correspondence, and at the
same time would be nothing concerning which the
regent could take action.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Excellent,&#8221; I said; &#8220;but these papers must
be prepared at once, mademoiselle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The duchess already has a thousand such,&#8221;
and the girl smiled. &#8220;She has been preparing
them for many months. It will be necessary only
to tie them together. But how shall we get them
into H&eacute;rault&#8217;s hands?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will deliver them,&#8221; I said. &#8220;Nobody knows
me in Paris.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good. That is arranged, then,&#8221; said Cellamare.
&#8220;Now as to these papers which you have
just given me, mademoiselle. Let us see what
they contain.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that moment there was a blinding flash of
lightning, and the rain, which had been long delayed,
came down in torrents. The room grew
very dark, and Cellamare arose and lighted two
candles which stood on the table.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>&#8220;These papers, M. le Prince,&#8221; said Mlle. de
Launay, as he sat down again, &#8220;contain a detailed
account of the aid we may expect in France. Let
me have them a moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cellamare shot a questioning glance in my direction,
which the girl intercepted.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have already had sufficient proof of the
fidelity of M. de Brancas,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;True!&#8221; he cried, heartily. &#8220;Pardon me, I
pray you, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In affairs of this kind,&#8221; I said, with a smile,
&#8220;it is necessary for one to be cautious. I am
quite ready to withdraw,&#8221; and I arose from my
chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stay, I beg of you,&#8221; and Cellamare also arose
and pressed me back. &#8220;Your advice will be invaluable.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl opened the packet and drew out one of
the papers.</p>

<p>&#8220;This,&#8221; she said, &#8220;is a statement of the forces
which will muster to our support in Brittany. As
you see, we can count upon nearly all the noble
houses. Here is the name of each of them and
the number of troops each can muster.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; said Cellamare, taking the paper and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
looking it over carefully. &#8220;This promises at
least eight thousand men.&#8221;</p>

<p>She opened another paper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here is a statement from Bayonne,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;The town will be opened to the Spanish troops
without resistance. The regiment quartered there,
which is commanded by the Duc de Richelieu, will
join the Spanish army, and the town has also
promised to raise a regiment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A good point,&#8221; and Cellamare scanned this
paper as he had the first. &#8220;This will give us a
stronghold on the border of France, through which
we can advance upon Paris. And two regiments
are not to be laughed at.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mlle. de Launay opened a third paper.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a statement of de Mesmes, president
of parliament,&#8221; she said. &#8220;He has gained to our
interests a majority of the members, and so soon
as we strike a blow the parliament will declare for
us and will instruct the citizen soldiery of Paris
to take up arms in our behalf.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, ah!&#8221; and Cellamare&#8217;s eyes were sparkling.
&#8220;This is best of all. We shall be able to strike
the regency right at its heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl doubtless felt the enthusiasm of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
Spaniard, but she preserved an admirable composure.
As for me, I judged it best to use my ears
and not my tongue.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a statement from Cardinal de Polignac,&#8221;
she continued, opening yet another paper.
&#8220;It was he, you may remember, who in 1797
caused the Prince de Conti to be chosen King of
Poland, although, unfortunately, he never ascended
the throne. Still, the Poles idolized him and they
remember Polignac. Five thousand lances are
assembling at the frontier and will be ready to follow
him into France in a week&#8217;s time. They are
concentrating at two points, Arlon and Landau.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing could be better!&#8221; cried Cellamare,
and as for myself, I confess that I felt slipping
from me one by one the doubts I had entertained
as to the success of the conspiracy.</p>

<p>&#8220;The other papers are of less importance,&#8221; she
concluded, &#8220;though important enough in themselves.
These, for instance, are pledges of support
from the Marquis de Pompadour and the
Marquis de Laval, who will bring us the united
strength of the Montmorencies. Here are some
papers from the Abb&eacute; Brigaut, who has attended
to much of the correspondence for us, assisted by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
the Chevalier de Menil, and who assures us that
half the remaining nobility of the kingdom, who
have been insulted by the regent, will be with us.
And here are a dozen others of the same kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All of which would have made interesting
reading for the regent,&#8221; I remarked, dryly, and
Cellamare nodded thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now, M. le Prince, what have you done?&#8221;
demanded the girl, with blazing eyes. &#8220;Madame
du Maine wishes me to urge haste above everything.
To-day&#8217;s affair shows we have no time to
lose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I received a letter this morning from Cardinal
Alberoni, prime minister of Spain,&#8221; answered Cellamare,
&#8220;and he assures me that the armies of
Spain will be ready to cross the frontiers of France
in a week&#8217;s time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall, then, send out instructions to all
our allies to strike the first blow one week from
to-day. Do you agree?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One week from to-day let it be,&#8221; said Cellamare,
his hands trembling with emotion.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the fifteenth of December. One week
from to-day will be the twenty-second. At seven
in the morning, then, let Philip of Spain be proclaimed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
regent of France. Do you your part, M.
le Prince, and Madame du Maine will do hers.&#8221;
I swear she was the coolest of the three.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is agreed,&#8221; and Cellamare bowed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, monsieur,&#8221; said mademoiselle to me,
&#8220;let us hasten back and inform the duchess of our
decision.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what of our wounded friend in the room
there?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will attend to him,&#8221; said Cellamare, &#8220;and
see that he is kept in a place where he can do no
harm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All is arranged then; come,&#8221; and Mlle. de
Launay hurried from the room and down the
stairs.</p>

<p>The clocks were striking three as we reached the
street. The sky had cleared and the sun was
shining, but the rainfall had been very heavy.
The streets were filled with water almost to the
houses, and the wide gutters in the middle had
been converted into great turgid streams. Across
these planks were thrown here and there, forming
rude bridges for the accommodation of pedestrians.
We picked our way along the slippery
stones near the houses, my companion choosing a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
circuitous route which finally brought us again to
the Rue des Frondeurs, and along it to the Rue St.
Honor&eacute;. Here the floods of water from the
neighboring streets had concentrated into a perfect
river, through which a continuous stream of
carriages splashed, making it impossible to keep
the bridges in position.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, what shall we do?&#8221; she cried, as we
stopped at the edge of this torrent. &#8220;We must
not remain here. How are we to cross?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see only one way, mademoiselle,&#8221; I answered,
and before she could protest I caught her up in my
arms and was splashing through the muddy water.
Just as I reached the middle of it a passing carriage
barred my progress. An irresistible attraction
drew my eyes to the window, and I saw there
the face of Louise Dacour. She was looking into
my eyes, a disdainful smile just curving her lips.
I bowed to her, but she made no sign of recognition,
and in an instant had disappeared.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br />


<small>AT THE TH&Eacute;&Acirc;TRE-FRAN&Ccedil;AIS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">I left</span> Mlle. de Launay at the Tuileries, promising
to call at eight o&#8217;clock for the papers, and
returned to the Rue des Saints P&egrave;res in no very
happy frame of mind. Why Mlle. Dacour had
chosen to ignore me was a problem which I tried
in vain to solve, and preoccupied with this mystery,
I pushed my way through the crowd without
seeing it. Jacques had dinner awaiting my return,
and after changing my clothes, which had
been sadly bespattered in the passage of the Rue
St. Honor&eacute;, I hastened to appease my hunger.
When I was once more alone before the fire with
a bottle of wine at my elbow, I turned again to the
solution of the problem. But in all those sweet
perplexities of woman&#8217;s nature I was the merest
novice,&mdash;though I have since grown wiser by dint
of much careful study,&mdash;and I puzzled my head
to no purpose. Twilight came while I sat there
musing, and Jacques entered with the candles.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>&#8220;Has monsieur decided where he will spend
the evening?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, no,&#8221; I said. &#8220;I have an engagement
at eight o&#8217;clock, but &#8217;twill keep me no longer than
half an hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Permit me to remind monsieur that M. le Duc
has always places reserved at the Op&eacute;ra and the
Com&eacute;die, and that these are at monsieur&#8217;s service.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A thousand thanks, Jacques, for your thoughtfulness!&#8221;
I cried. &#8220;And what is the programme
for this evening?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Op&eacute;ra will be closed, as a new piece is
in preparation there, but at the Com&eacute;die will be
produced M. Voltaire&#8217;s tragedy of &#8216;&#338;dipe,&#8217; which
has created such a furore since its first representation
a month ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>In fact, I had myself seen many of the bills announcing
the tragedy and had heard some talk
of it on the streets.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall go,&#8221; I said. &#8220;Thanks, again, for your
thoughtfulness, Jacques.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will see that M. le Duc&#8217;s place is at the disposal
of monsieur,&#8221; he answered, and withdrew.</p>

<p>I looked over my wardrobe with care and selected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
the most elaborate costume I possessed, as
best suited to the fashionable world of the theatre
into which I was about to venture. I heard seven
o&#8217;clock striking as I finished my toilet, and knowing
that I had no time to lose, I buckled on my
sword and left the house, declining a carriage
which Jacques offered me, since my first errand
must be done on foot. It was not yet eight o&#8217;clock
when I reached the Tuileries and entered the salon,
but the usual crowd had already assembled, and
several of the men bowed to me as I passed. One
of these was the Chevalier de Rey, who stopped
me for a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Has Richelieu left the city, monsieur?&#8221; he
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has joined his regiment at Bayonne,&#8221; I
answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said de Rey, with a smile of intelligence,
&#8220;the time, then, is not far distant,&#8221; and he turned
away with his news to a neighboring group.</p>

<p>I continued on my way down the room, and met
Mlle. de Launay as she entered.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are prompt, M. de Brancas,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Here are the papers,&#8221; and she handed me a
packet resembling in outward appearance at least<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
that she had given to Cellamare in the afternoon.
&#8220;I fancy they will keep H&eacute;rault, Dubois,
and the regent busy for a time,&#8221; she added, with
a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;I trust so, at all events,&#8221; I answered, as I took
the papers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a moment, monsieur,&#8221; she continued,
placing her hand lightly upon my arm as I turned
away. &#8220;Madame appreciates thoroughly your
share in this afternoon&#8217;s adventure and charged
me expressly to thank you in her name. She
realizes that but for you our plans would even
now be in the hands of the regent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was glad to be of service,&#8221; I said, simply,
&#8220;and hope to prove this many times within the
next few weeks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe you, monsieur,&#8221; and she looked into
my eyes. &#8220;Madame and myself both feel that
we can trust you. We are happy to have found
such an ally.&#8221;</p>

<p>I thanked her again and took my leave, as Polignac
came to us and engaged her in conversation,
for I was ill at ease. It seemed to me that I was
being dragged into the conspiracy much deeper
than I had bargained for, and yet I saw no way to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
extricate myself, however much I might wish to
do so. And I realized more vividly than ever that
I was not made for intrigue.</p>

<p>I was anxious to have the errand done, and I
hurried from the place and made my way to the
Rue Jean St. Denis, down which I turned until I
reached the Rue de Beauvais. Here an unforeseen
difficulty confronted me, for though I knew I was
to leave the papers with the concierge of the corner
house, I did not know which corner. As the Rue
Jean St. Denis ended here, there were only two corners
to choose from, and I looked at these with attention.
The building on the right was a handsome
edifice of four stories, extending down the
Rue de Beauvais to the Rue Fromenteau, and
along the Rue Jean St. Denis a corresponding distance.
I reflected that H&eacute;rault would not be likely
to choose the concierge of such an imposing edifice
as a depository for his papers, and turned my attention
to the opposite side. The corner house here
was a small one, stuck in, as it were, to fill an angle
left by the two adjoining buildings. It was only
two stories in height, the ground floor being occupied
by a cabaret which seemed well patronized.
I decided at once that this was the place, and, pulling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
my hat down over my eyes and wrapping my
cloak about my face, I approached it.</p>

<p>I looked about, but could discover no sign of a
concierge, and turned the corner into the Rue de
Beauvais. Here fortune favored me, for I found
a little court which gave entrance to the interior
of the building. In one corner of this court was a
hut of one room, with a large window commanding
the entrance. By the candle within I saw a little
old man sitting at a table, apparently asleep. I
opened the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you the concierge?&#8221; I asked, touching him
with my foot.</p>

<p>He awoke with a start and sat blinking at me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I asked if you are the concierge,&#8221; I repeated.</p>

<p>&#8220;The concierge?&#8221; he stammered. &#8220;Yes, yes.
What is it, monsieur?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You sometimes receive papers and letters, do
you not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sometimes, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what do you do with them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I give them to the person for whom they
are intended, monsieur,&#8221; and he smiled cunningly.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; I said. &#8220;I see you are my man.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
These must be delivered to that person at once.
Tell me the first letter of his name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good. Here are the papers,&#8221; and I gave him
the packet and turned to leave.</p>

<p>&#8220;But your name, monsieur?&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;He will know from whom they come,&#8221; I answered.
&#8220;It is always safer not to mention
names,&#8221; and I hurried from the place, for I feared
that one of H&eacute;rault&#8217;s agents might arrive while I
was there. I met no one, however, and turning up
the Rue du Chantre, soon reached the Palais Royal.</p>

<p>The Th&eacute;&acirc;tre-Fran&ccedil;ais occupied a portion of
the left wing, and the entrance was crowded
with gayly dressed people. Thanks to Jacques,
who had been before me, I had no difficulty in
securing the place reserved for Richelieu at the
right of the stage, and I looked about me with no
little interest and some astonishment. The hall
was not very large and but indifferently lighted.
Two rows of boxes extended in a semicircle around
it, encircling the pit, which was without seats. It
was already filled with a crush of people, who were
compelled to stand on tiptoe and look over each
other&#8217;s shoulders to catch a glimpse of the stage.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
The stage itself appeared to be a mere strip of
planks in the midst of this sea of people, for on
either side of it were four rows of seats, one
above the other, enclosed in a gilt railing, and
at the back thirty or forty people were standing,
through whom the actors must force their
way in order to reach the front. As was inevitable
in such a multitude, there was a perfect
babel of conversation. Most of the boxes
were still empty, but from the pit came an uproar
indescribable. The din was increased by dealers
in lemonade and sweetmeats, who pushed their
way through the crowd crying their wares.</p>

<p>The boxes filled gradually, most of them being
occupied by elegantly attired ladies, many of whom
were masked. My attention was attracted by a
party of especially distinguished appearance which
entered the box across from mine. It consisted of
three ladies, all wearing masks.</p>

<p>The ringing of a bell drew my eyes to the stage,
and those who had come only to see the assembling
of the audience withdrew and received their money
back as they passed out. A boy snuffed the row
of candles which served as footlights, and the bell
tapped a second time. Something like stillness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
fell upon the house, and I saw two gentlemen
attired in the mode of Paris, with swords at their
sides, precisely as had every gentleman in the audience,
break a way through the crowd at the back
of the stage and advance to the front. One, so the
playbill told me, was the Prince of Eub&#339;a, and the
other his friend Dimas, and the opening couplet
was ringing in the air,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;Philoct&egrave;te, est-ce vous? Quel coup affreux du sort</div>
<div class="verse">Dans ces lieux empest&eacute;s vous fait chercer la mort?&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>From that instant I forgot the audience and no
longer saw the anachronism which gave this Greek
tragedy all the appointments of a French contemporary
drama. I heard only the majesty of the
lines, as the story moved on without interruption
to the tragedy which was its climax. Thunders
of applause interrupted the actors at every moment.
The audience found in the first scene a reference
to the king, then only eight years old, and to the
regent. These were clapped to the echo, and the
actors were recalled at the end of the scene.</p>

<p>The act once over, the hubbub of voices arose
again, and I had leisure to look about me. Unconsciously
my eyes wandered to the box opposite,
and I started as I fancied I saw one of the masked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
ladies make a motion to me with her fan. I told
myself I must be mistaken, but a moment later the
signal was repeated. I arose from my chair and
looked questioningly at her, still incredulous of
my good fortune. She nodded her head and again
beckoned with her fan. This time there was no
mistaking her meaning, and I hurried from my
box and made my way through the crowd as
rapidly as possible to the other side of the theatre.
With fast-beating heart I tapped at the door of the
box where the three ladies sat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Enter, monsieur,&#8221; said a low voice, which I
recognized at once as that of Mlle. de Valois.
&#8220;Ah, M. de Brancas,&#8221; she continued, holding out
her hand, &#8220;you are welcome. But I am ashamed
of you, sir. Do you always compel a lady to give
you three invitations?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was because I could not believe in my good
fortune, mademoiselle,&#8221; I cried. &#8220;Had I known
who you were, I fear I should not have waited for
even one invitation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see my mask is no disguise, monsieur,&#8221;
laughed the princess, &#8220;for you seem to know me
now. Pray tell me, do you know these other
ladies?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>&#8220;I know Mlle. Dacour,&#8221; I answered, bowing
to one of the other two, who remained silent, apparently
absorbed in watching the crowd in the pit.</p>

<p>&#8220;And how do you know that?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;By the beating of my heart, mademoiselle,&#8221; I
answered.</p>

<p>The princess laughed merrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;A pretty compliment, upon my word,&#8221; she
cried. &#8220;Come, Louise, are you not going to give
M. de Brancas your hand to kiss as a reward?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;M. de Brancas is too fond of kissing hands,&#8221;
she retorted, without looking at me. &#8220;Let him
find others, as he has doubtless already done.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mlle. de Valois glanced at my lugubrious face
and burst into another peal of laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is too amusing,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;But first,
monsieur, let me introduce you to this other lady,
concerning whom your heart tells you nothing,&mdash;my
sister, Mlle. de Chartres.&#8221;</p>

<p>I bowed to the lady, who was apparently some
years older than Mlle. de Valois, and who smiled
at me graciously. The princess was still laughing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, come, M. de Brancas,&#8221; she said, &#8220;put off
that melancholy air. You should rejoice rather
than despair, for, do you know, Louise is doing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
you the honor of being jealous of you. This afternoon
we were out driving, and in the Rue St.
Honor&eacute; who should we see but M. de Brancas
wading across the street and with a young and
pretty woman held very affectionately in his arms.
It made my blood leap and I was for cheering you
from the carriage window, but Louise held me
back, and in a moment you were gone. I thought
it fine, but she said it was disgraceful, and I nearly
died with laughing at her indignant face.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, this is too much!&#8221; cried Mlle. Dacour,
starting from her seat. &#8220;I will not remain here
to be insulted in this manner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, do not go, mademoiselle!&#8221; I implored.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, stay, Louise,&#8221; said the princess. &#8220;I
promise not to tease you further. Besides,&#8221; she
added, mischievously, &#8220;M. de Brancas doubtless
has an explanation to offer, and perhaps he was
not holding her so affectionately as I imagined.&#8221;</p>

<p>I would have told them at once that it had been
a question of necessity and not at all of affection,
but at that moment the bell rang and the second
act began. I forgot my fair companions in the
interest of the tragedy. The laughing voice of
Mlle. de Valois aroused me.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>&#8220;Ah, M. de Brancas,&#8221; she said, &#8220;it is evident
that you have never before seen the &#8216;&#338;dipe.&#8217;
Here, sit beside me. If you are very good and
answer my questions nicely I shall let you sit beside
Louise, and you will have only yourself to
blame if you do not make peace with her. She is
dying of curiosity to learn the lady&#8217;s name. Have
you heard from Richelieu?&#8221; she asked in a lower
tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have heard only that he is on the road to
Bayonne,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you think he should remain there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe it would be best for the present,
mademoiselle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, but, M. de Brancas,&#8221; she said, &#8220;suppose
you were Richelieu and I Louise Dacour. Would
you remain at Bayonne? Do not answer me, I
see in your face that you would not. Listen.
Richelieu will be in Paris to-morrow night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To-morrow night,&#8221; I gasped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. He will doubtless go first to his hotel,
where you will meet him. So soon as you see him
give him this note,&#8221; and she handed me a little
perfumed missive. &#8220;The note, I may as well tell
you, states that at ten o&#8217;clock to-morrow night I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
shall be at the house of a friend in the Rue Jean
Tison, the third house from the corner of the Rue
Bailleul, on the right-hand side. Rap three times
and the door will be opened to you without question.
Mount the stairs to the first floor. Louise
will be there also. Do you understand, monsieur?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; I said, and placed the note in my
pocket.</p>

<p>&#8220;You do not seem to consider any longer the
danger to which Richelieu will be exposed,&#8221; she
said, slyly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, if Louise is there,&#8221; I murmured.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are charming, M. de Brancas,&#8221; said the
princess, and she gave me an adorable smile.
&#8220;Now take your reward. Sit by her side and
whisper a few sentences such as that into those
little pink ears of hers. She will soon be smiling.&#8221;</p>

<p>The end of the second act gave me the opportunity
of changing my seat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, mademoiselle,&#8221; I whispered, as I sat down
beside her, &#8220;believe me, there are only two hands
in the whole world that I desire to kiss,&mdash;those two
which are lying in your lap.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who was the lady you were with this afternoon?&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
she asked, not deigning to glance at me,
but gazing straight in front of her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mlle. de Launay,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mlle. de Launay?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know her, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Richelieu introduced us. Madame du Maine
asked me to accompany her this afternoon on an
errand. On our way back to the Tuileries we
found the way blocked by the flooded street. She
was in haste, and as there was no other way, I carried
her across. I did not enjoy the task, I assure
you, mademoiselle.&#8221;</p>

<p>She glanced at me, and I thought I saw signs of
relenting in her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Louise,&#8221; cried the duchess, &#8220;we must
go. It was not to see the &#8216;&#338;dipe&#8217; that we came
here. We have accomplished our mission and must
return.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Till to-morrow, then,&#8221; I whispered to Louise
as the ladies arose, and I fancied that she gave a
slight affirmative nod of the head. I would have
accompanied them, but the princess waved me back,
and I returned to my box to witness the remainder
of the play. It moved me strongly, and I was still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
thinking over its stirring periods as I reached the
quays and crossed the river. As I turned down
the Quai Malaquest I fancied I heard footsteps
behind me, but when I turned, saw no one. The
street was very dark, the candles, which swung
here and there in lanterns twenty feet above the
roadway, having been extinguished by a gust of
rain earlier in the evening and no attempt having
been made to relight them.</p>

<p>I was stumbling on over the uneven pavement,
when suddenly half a dozen shadows detached
themselves from the wall in front of me, and at
the same instant I heard hastening footsteps in my
rear. Before I could draw my sword, or even, in
fact, appreciate my danger, a dozen men threw
themselves upon me. A gag was thrust into my
mouth, a scarf bound over my eyes, my hands and
feet were tied, and in a moment I was helpless.
Some one was searching my pockets.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some more of the Cartouche gang,&#8221; I thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;Handle him as gently as possible,&#8221; I heard a
voice say. &#8220;Now two of you lift him and bring
him along.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was lifted from the pavement and borne along
for some distance. Then I was placed in a carriage,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
which was driven rapidly through the
streets. It rumbled across a bridge, stopped, and
I heard a sentry&#8217;s challenge.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Bastille again,&#8221; I groaned to myself.</p>

<p>The carriage drove on and then came to a sudden
stop. I was lifted out and carried into a room,
the door of which I heard closed after me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Untie him,&#8221; commanded a voice, and in a
moment my hands and feet were free, the gag was
taken from my mouth and the scarf whisked from
my eyes. A man of middle age in the uniform of
an officer of the guards stood before me.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the first time I have had the pleasure of
meeting you, M. de Brancas,&#8221; he said, smiling.
&#8220;I trust we shall be good friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The beginning of our acquaintance does not
seem to me a happy one,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;But may
I ask your name, monsieur?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am called H&eacute;rault, lieutenant of police,&#8221; and
he bowed.</p>

<p>&#8220;H&eacute;rault?&#8221; I exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;At your service,&#8221; and he bowed again.</p>

<p>&#8220;And why have I been arrested, monsieur?&#8221; I
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, do not use so harsh a word!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
assure you, monsieur, you are not arrested, but
merely detained. There is no charge against you,
and on my word you shall be free again day after
to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But in the mean time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the mean time, monsieur, you will be my
guest, and I shall strive to make your stay a pleasant
one.&#8221;</p>

<p>I searched his face with my eyes, but it told me
nothing. With a start I remembered the rendezvous,
and my hand sought my pocket. The note
Mlle. de Valois had given me was gone. In an
instant I understood. The regent was setting
another trap for Richelieu.</p>

<p>H&eacute;rault read my face as he would have read an
open book.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see you are beginning to understand, M. de
Brancas,&#8221; he said, still smiling. &#8220;It would be inconvenient
to have you present at certain scenes
which are to occur say twenty-four hours from
now. Consequently you will be my guest for
thirty-six hours.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was still dazed at the discovery of this trap,
and my mind was stumbling blindly along its intricacies.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>&#8220;How did you learn of the existence of this
note, monsieur?&#8221; I asked at length, finding here a
problem which I could not solve.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, M. de Brancas,&#8221; cried H&eacute;rault, &#8220;it was
there that you displayed an indiscretion which surprised
me. Did you for a moment suppose that a
masked lady, whose identity, however, was well
known, could give you a note in a crowded house
where there were twenty of my agents without this
being perceived? Did you believe that you could
talk of a rendezvous in a theatre box and not be
overheard, provided the police wished to overhear
you? You will answer, of course, that you talked
in a low voice, but permit me to tell you something,
monsieur, which may be of value to you in
the future. In a theatre, a hall, or any place where
there is a great crowd of people and consequently
much noise, a single human voice seems to its possessor
the most feeble instrument in the world.
And yet, no matter how great the confusion,
trained ears, such as my agents possess, can pick
out that voice and follow it as though it were
speaking alone in the stillness of the grave.&#8221;</p>

<p>I understood but too clearly, and cursed my own
folly and that of Mlle. de Valois.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>&#8220;As I said before,&#8221; continued H&eacute;rault, &#8220;you are
my guest. You are at my house in the Rue de
Perpignan. But do not think of escape, monsieur.
Twenty men guard every door and avenue of escape.
I shall be obliged to station six in your
apartment. They will be fully armed, and as you
have not even your sword,&#8221;&mdash;I placed my hand
at my side and found that my sword was indeed
gone,&mdash;&#8220;you can easily realize how foolhardy it
would be to attack them. They have instructions
to kill you rather than permit you to escape, and I
should be truly sorry to have the incident end so
unhappily.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused for a moment as though to allow his
words to take effect, and then motioned me to follow
him. We mounted two steep and narrow
flights of stairs, passing several sentries on the
way, and stopped before a door on the third floor.
This H&eacute;rault opened, and we entered. Six soldiers,
all armed with swords and muskets, were
pacing up and down inside. An open door disclosed
another and smaller room, in which there
was a bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I trust you will be comfortable here, monsieur,&#8221;
said H&eacute;rault. &#8220;After all, it will be only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
for a short time. Is there anything you desire?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing, monsieur,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night, then,&#8221; and casting another glance
around the apartment to assure himself that all
was right, he withdrew. I heard him giving some
orders outside the door, a bolt was thrown, and
all was still. The six guards in my apartment continued
marching up and down without saying a
word. I realized that nothing could be done that
night, and appreciating the value of sleep in clearing
the brain and steadying the nerves, I undressed
and went to bed. As I entered the smaller room
two of the guards took their station at its open
door, where they could observe my every movement,
and I smiled to myself at the thought that
H&eacute;rault must indeed consider me formidable.</p>

<small>THE GAME OF PRISONER&#8217;S CHASE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">I am</span> fond of lying in bed in the morning and
thinking over the situation in which I find myself,
as the reader doubtless knows already if he has
had the patience to come thus far with me, and
when I awoke in the house of M. H&eacute;rault I was
in no hurry to arise. I was able to see quite clearly
all the workings of this trap which had been set for
Richelieu. He would arrive at Paris in the evening
and would proceed to his hotel. There he
would find the note from Mlle. de Valois awaiting
him. H&eacute;rault could easily find a way to deliver it
without exciting suspicion. Richelieu might wonder
at my absence, but I knew him well enough to
know that suspicion or even certainty of foul play
would not for a moment deter him from keeping
the appointment which she had given him. He
would, then, at ten o&#8217;clock, proceed to the house
in the Rue Jean Tison, the third from the end, on
the right-hand side. He would rap three times and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
would be admitted, and a moment later H&eacute;rault&#8217;s
men would break open the door, overwhelm him,
and carry him off to the Bastille. This time there
would be no escape, and I shuddered as I thought
what the end would be.</p>

<p>I bounded out of bed. The clothes were suffocating
me. It was time for action.</p>

<p>Two guards stood at my door watching me
closely. Four others were in the outer room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-morning, gentlemen,&#8221; I said, reflecting
that I could lose nothing by being on good terms
with these men. &#8220;You must have had a weary
time of it watching all night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We went on duty only an hour ago, monsieur,&#8221;
said one of them, who seemed to be in command.
&#8220;The watches were changed while you slept.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And how long will you be on duty?&#8221; I asked,
carelessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Twelve hours, or until ten o&#8217;clock to-night,
monsieur,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, you have long hours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have always long hours in the police, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that moment the outer door was opened, and
a servant appeared bringing my breakfast.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>&#8220;Excellent!&#8221; I cried, entering the outer room
and looking at the repast, which was indeed
elaborate. &#8220;I see I shall have no cause to complain
of M. H&eacute;rault&#8217;s hospitality. Have you
breakfasted, lieutenant?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Two hours ago, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Two hours ago! Great heavens, man, your
stomach must be an aching emptiness by this time!
Sit down, I beg of you. There is enough here for
two and some to spare for your men.&#8221;</p>

<p>I saw that the man was indeed hungry and
looked at my breakfast with eager eyes, but he
shook his head at my invitation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, come, monsieur,&#8221; I said, &#8220;why should we
refuse to be civil to each other just because I am
prisoner and you are guard? It seems to me that
a little good feeling will make the day pass more
quickly for both of us. Even if you cannot eat,
bear me company, I beg of you, for I abhor sitting
down alone to table,&#8221; and I gently forced him
into a chair and myself took the one opposite. He
yielded, though still with a show of reluctance,
and I maintained a lively conversation while we
ate, carefully avoiding any remark which could
appear suspicious, and finally succeeded in drawing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
the man out a little. I ordered another bottle
of wine, and treated the five soldiers to a glass
apiece, a courtesy which I saw they appreciated.
Breakfast was finally finished and we arose.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a charming view!&#8221; I cried, sauntering
to the window and gazing down over the river.
&#8220;M. H&eacute;rault&#8217;s house overlooks the Seine it appears.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It stands upon the bank, monsieur,&#8221; answered
the lieutenant, who had followed me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, monsieur,&#8221; I said, turning to him and
seemingly taking no further interest in the view,
&#8220;I have not yet asked your name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lieutenant Bernin, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Lieutenant Bernin,&#8221; I cried, &#8220;I foresee
that we are going to pass a very pleasant day together,&#8221;
and I turned again to an apparently careless
scrutiny of the scene. I could catch but a
glimpse of the river below the window, from which
I judged that the house not only stood upon the
bank, but that the upper stories projected out over
the water, after the fashion of many of the older
houses standing along the Seine. In a moment I
saw a possible way of escape. A drop of forty feet
to a stone pavement was not to be thought of;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
but a drop of forty feet into the water was another
matter. I turned away from the window, trembling
lest by some motion I might betray my
thought. I examined the window itself attentively
when I could do so unobserved, and saw that it
was of the ordinary kind, with a sash which could
be readily broken by a blow with a chair or any
other heavy object. The problem was to keep my
guards at a distance during the moment it would
take me to break a passage and drop into the water.
It was a problem not easy of solution, and I retired
to the bedroom and lay down upon the bed
to think it over.</p>

<p>The bedroom was about ten feet square, without
windows and with only one door, that opening
into the outer room. This door was of some
strength, and had a bolt on the outer side, so that
by merely closing it and throwing the bolt they
could make me a prisoner in this small room. If
it were only the soldiers who were in the bedroom
and I who were outside, an instant would suffice
to bolt the door, and it would be several minutes
at least before they could break it down,&mdash;more
time certainly than I should need to get through
the window. In a moment I had my plan, and I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
spent some half-hour working out all its details.</p>

<p>The remainder of the morning passed quickly,
and when my dinner appeared H&eacute;rault accompanied
it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been taxing myself with being inhospitable,
M. de Brancas,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but I beg of
you to believe that it was the most urgent business
which prevented my coming to see you earlier.
A lieutenant of police never gets time to rest or to
see his friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can well believe it,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;You
are going to dine with me, are you not, monsieur?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If it pleases you to have a companion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing could please me more,&#8221; I said, heartily,
for I really admired the man; and as we sat
down I examined his face with interest. It was a
face which, even animated as at this moment, was
still as impenetrable as a wall of stone. The firmly
set lips and aggressive chin showed a man not
wanting in decision, and I did not doubt that those
cool, gray eyes could become two poniards when it
was a question of obtaining a confession from a
prisoner.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>&#8220;I need not tell you, monsieur,&#8221; I said, after a
moment, &#8220;how deeply your system of police espionage
interests me. I have already had two or
three proofs of the thoroughness of its work, and
it seems to me a wonderful organization. Do you
object to telling me more about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; he answered, smiling. &#8220;There is
nothing secret about the general principles of our
system. What is it you would like to know, monsieur?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me how it is organized,&mdash;how it proceeds,&#8221;
I answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was the Comte d&#8217;Argenson who brought it
to its present state of perfection,&#8221; began H&eacute;rault.
&#8220;He was, as you perhaps know, my predecessor,
and held the position for nineteen years. It was
for Louis the Great that the thorough organization
of the secret department was undertaken. He
had, as you have doubtless heard, a great liking for
scandal, and for many years the chief duty of the
department was to discover intrigues and liaisons.
He devoted an hour every morning to listening to
the report of the police department, and nothing
pleased him so greatly as the details of some love-affair.
These, it need hardly be said, he would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
repeat later in the day to his court, to the great
confusion of the parties concerned. Under d&#8217;Argenson
the secret agents were trained to a remarkable
degree of perfection, and I found my work
ready for my hand when I entered the office.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have, then, a great number of agents?&#8221;
I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are everywhere, monsieur,&#8221; answered
H&eacute;rault, with a smile. &#8220;They constitute the eye
which sees everything and the ear which hears
everything happening in Paris. You will say, no
doubt, that intrigues are not always exposed, that
crimes are not always punished. Believe me, monsieur,
it is not because they are not known. Reasons
of state sometimes step in to protect the guilty
ones; at other times the regent prefers to wait,
playing with them as a cat plays with a mouse, only
in the end to crush them more completely.&#8221;</p>

<p>I glanced at H&eacute;rault to discover what meaning
might lie hidden behind these words, but his face
told me nothing. He turned the conversation upon
indifferent topics, indicating that he had said all
he cared to say about the police department, and
a few moments later he arose to go.</p>

<p>&#8220;The time of your release is drawing near,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
monsieur,&#8221; he said. &#8220;A little patience, and when
the morning comes you will be free again. Is
there anything you wish?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May I have a pack of cards and a piece of
chalk?&#8221; I asked. &#8220;There is no objection, I suppose,
to M. Bernin here playing with me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;None whatever,&#8221; answered H&eacute;rault. &#8220;The
cards shall be sent you, monsieur,&#8221; and he was
gone.</p>

<p>The cards soon came, and the afternoon passed
quickly. Bernin was very fond of play and, as I
permitted him to win the few pistoles I possessed,
he arose from the table in great good humor. Supper
came with the candles. Bernin joined me, at
my invitation, no longer making a pretence of holding
back, and his five companions each received
another glass of wine.</p>

<p>&#8220;You desire your revenge, doubtless, monsieur,&#8221;
said Bernin, as we finished, and I saw that
he was trembling with eagerness to resume the
cards.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, let us play,&#8221; I answered, and we continued
the game. My apparent resignation to my
fate had completely disarmed the suspicions of the
men, and they were grouped about the table watching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
the fall of the cards. An hour passed, and nine
o&#8217;clock sounded from Notre Dame. It was time
to act.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, M. Bernin,&#8221; I said, yawning and throwing
down the cards, &#8220;this is growing wearisome.
I know a better game than this. Let me explain it
to you.&#8221; I picked up the piece of chalk and glanced
around at the walls. &#8220;My bedroom is the best
place,&#8221; I said. &#8220;Come with me,&#8221; and I caught up
one of the candles and led the way. Bernin followed
me.</p>

<p>&#8220;The game,&#8221; I said, &#8220;is called &#8216;Prisoner&#8217;s
Chase,&#8217; and may be played in a number of ways.
The one which I am about to show you is, however,
the best.&#8221; I held the candle in one hand and drew
a diagram on the wall with the other. &#8220;You will
observe,&#8221; I continued, &#8220;the board is in the form
of a cross, and at the upper end of the cross is the
stronghold, or fortress. Within this fortress is
the prisoner. Without it are six guards,&#8221; and I
rapidly indicated their positions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; said Bernin. &#8220;I find the game interesting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will find it more so before it is ended,&#8221;
I said. &#8220;The guards are limited to moving in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
straight lines and only one base at a time. The
prisoner, on the contrary, like the queen in chess,
can move the whole length of the board if necessary.
The problem is for the prisoner to compel
the six guards to enter the castle, in order to avoid
capture, while he himself escapes. If he cannot
do this he loses.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand,&#8221; said Bernin. &#8220;The prisoner
has need to use his brain. A charming game.&#8221;</p>

<p>I glanced over my shoulder and saw that two of
the other guards had entered the room and were
watching my diagram with interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us now play the game,&#8221; I said. &#8220;The
guards are drawn up in a line across one end of
the board. The prisoner is within the castle. If
they can advance in an unbroken line to the castle
wall they cut off all possibility of escape and the
prisoner loses. They advance to the attack. Ah,
but see, they have left a break in the line. The
prisoner sees it. He has been waiting this opportunity.
He swoops out. This man must
either retreat or be taken. He retreats. He is
within the castle. Once in he cannot get out.
The prisoner has now only five men against
him.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>Another of the guards had entered the room and
was watching the game.</p>

<p>&#8220;Again the guards advance,&#8221; I continued.
&#8220;Again they leave a space, since they cannot all
move together. A moment and the prisoner has
a second captive,&#8221; and I illustrated the word with
the action.</p>

<p>&#8220;Really,&#8221; declared Bernin, &#8220;I have never seen
a more exciting game.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The excitement is yet to come, monsieur,&#8221; I
cried, and a glance told me that the two remaining
guards were in the room. &#8220;You see there are
now only four guards at liberty, although those
within the castle are permitted to harass the
prisoner as much as is in their power. But those
outside have grown wary. They advance more
cautiously. They may still be able to surround and
overpower the prisoner. Ah, an opening! The
prisoner sees it. He is out in an instant. He has
another captive.&#8221; The six men were grouped
about me and I could feel their breath in my hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; cried Bernin, &#8220;I see. It is most
interesting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The most interesting part is yet to come, monsieur,&#8221;
I repeated. &#8220;Remember, the prisoner, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
win the game, must not only get all the guards
within the castle, but must so dispose them that he
can himself escape.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True,&#8221; and Bernin nodded, &#8220;but how will he
do it, monsieur?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will show you in a second,&#8221; I said, and at that
instant, apparently by accident, let the candle fall.
&#8220;One moment, gentlemen,&#8221; I cried. &#8220;I will bring
another candle, and will show you the conclusion
of this interesting game.&#8221;</p>

<p>I sprang into the outer room as though to get
another candle. In an instant I slammed the door
and shot the bolt. They comprehended my purpose
and were hammering at the door almost before
I could turn, but in the same moment I had
seized a chair and with a single blow dashed out
the window. I heard the door cracking, and the
guard on the staircase without, hearing the noise,
were throwing the bolts of the outer door to enter.
Even as the one door opened and the other gave
way I was through the window, hung a second
from the sill, and let myself drop. I shot downward
with the speed of a cannon-ball, as it seemed
to me, struck the water feet first with a mighty
splash, and disappeared beneath it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>I battled madly to regain the surface, and came
up like a cork. The darkness concealed me, but
from the lighted window I had just left half a
dozen excited faces were peering. I heard hoarse
shouts of alarm, and some one discharged a musket
in my direction, the ball ripping up the water
near my head. Without delaying a moment I swam
as rapidly as I could towards the opposite quay, and
as I gained it I heard renewed shouts behind me,
and saw a dozen men, holding aloft flaming
torches, tumbling into a boat. Luckily, in that
moment I found a landing-place, ran up it quickly
to the quay above, and in an instant had mingled
with the crowd.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br />


<small>RICHELIEU STANDS HIS GROUND</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">I knew</span> that I had no time to lose, and I hurried
along the quay as rapidly as the crowd would
permit, hoping to arrive at the Hotel de Richelieu
before the duke left the house. The half-hour was
striking as I reached my destination, entered the
court, and knocked at the door. It was Jacques
who opened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Richelieu here?&#8221; I asked, springing across
the threshold and motioning him to bar the door
after me, for at every moment I was expecting to
feel upon my shoulder the hand of one of H&eacute;rault&#8217;s
agents.</p>

<p>&#8220;M. le Duc left the house not ten minutes since,&#8221;
answered Jacques.</p>

<p>&#8220;And where did he go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was there a note left here for him to-day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, monsieur. A small perfumed note.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you gave it to Richelieu?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>&#8220;Not half an hour ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who delivered the note?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A man in the livery of the regent&#8217;s household,
monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>I groaned aloud. It was then as I had expected.
The livery of the regent&#8217;s household was of course
at the service of H&eacute;rault. I was for a moment
stunned.</p>

<p>&#8220;M. le Duc was greatly chagrined at not finding
you here, monsieur,&#8221; continued Jacques. &#8220;I told
him that you had attended the theatre last night
and had not returned. But monsieur is dripping
wet,&#8221; he cried in astonishment, as I advanced into
the circle of light cast by the hall lamp.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I said, looking somewhat ruefully at the
ruin of my best suit, &#8220;I have just come out of the
Seine, and it is not pleasant running through the
streets in wet garments on a December night. I
must have a change of clothes at once. If we are
prompt I may yet save Richelieu.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is in danger, then, monsieur?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the greatest danger,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;Come.&#8221;</p>

<p>We ran up the stairs, and with that promptness
which I had already so greatly admired, Jacques
produced a suit of clothing. In five minutes I was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
ready for the street, and snatching up a sword, descended
the staircase three steps at a time. As I
passed through the hall I glanced at the clock and
saw that I had yet twenty minutes in which to
reach the Rue Jean Tison. The rendezvous was
for ten o&#8217;clock.</p>

<p>I crossed the Pont Royal, and turning down
the Quai des Galleries du Louvre, as likely to be
least crowded, passed the Port St. Nicholas at a
run, and came to the Rue des Poulies. This led
me to the Rue Bailleul, which I remembered
only too well, and in a moment I was at the Rue
Jean Tison. The end of the street was blocked
by a house, through which a large gate-way was
pierced, and I passed through this and rapped at
the door of the third house on the right. As I
did so I heard ten o&#8217;clock striking from St. Honor&eacute;.
Some one fumbled at the bolts within, and
the door opened. A noise at the end of the street
caught my ear and I paused an instant on the
threshold. As I looked back, I saw approaching
from either direction a company of mounted
guards, their arms clanking and the hoofs of their
horses awakening a thousand echoes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bar the door quickly!&#8221; I said to the old woman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
who stood within holding a candle. &#8220;Where are
Richelieu and the ladies?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On the floor above, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without waiting for another word, I sprang up
the stairs and flung open the first door I came to.
By the dim light I saw Richelieu holding Mlle.
de Valois in his arms. She uttered a startled exclamation
as I entered, and drew away from him.</p>

<p>&#8220;M. le Duc,&#8221; I cried, &#8220;we have not a moment
to lose! There are forty guards at the door. We
must go, and quickly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Upon my soul it is de Brancas!&#8221; exclaimed
Richelieu. &#8220;And where have you been all day,
my friend?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not stop for questioning, I beg of you,&#8221; I
panted. &#8220;Is there any other way out of this
house?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know. I will see,&#8221; and the princess
ran to the door, where we heard her rapidly interrogating
the old woman. At that moment a thunderous
knock sounded on the door below and
echoed through the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, monsieur, what is happening?&#8221; cried a
voice which made me start. &#8220;Is this another
trap?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>&#8220;It looks very much like it, Mlle. Dacour,&#8221;
replied Richelieu, gloomily, and turned towards
the door with frowning face.</p>

<p>There was a second knock louder than the first,
which shook the house and made the windows
rattle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Open or we will force an entrance!&#8221; cried a
voice outside.</p>

<p>There was an instant&#8217;s silence, and the princess
came back to us, her face white with fear.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no way of getting out except by the
door below,&#8221; she faltered.</p>

<p>&#8220;But there must be!&#8221; I cried. &#8220;The roof,&mdash;can
we not escape by the roof? Come, M. le Duc,
I implore you,&#8221; for, seemingly oblivious to the
sounds below, he had gone to his mistress and was
whispering in her ear.</p>

<p>In a moment he turned to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;De Brancas,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I am weary of this
perpetual game of hide-and-seek. I am tired of
forever running away. I swore last time that I
should never do it again. Go, my friend. As for
me, I intend to stay.&#8221;</p>

<p>I looked at him aghast. He was smiling calmly
and was holding out his hand to me.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>&#8220;But to stay means to be captured,&#8221; I stammered,
not yet understanding him. &#8220;We cannot
defeat a regiment, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That may be,&#8221; and the duke still smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the Bastille.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very likely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; but here I paused.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on, my friend,&#8221; said Richelieu, calmly, &#8220;I
read your thought. You would say that after the
Bastille the Place de Greve and the block. Is it
not so? But heads do not fall so easily, de Brancas.
The regent would think twice before sending
me to the axe.&#8221;</p>

<p>Blows were raining upon the door, and I knew
that it must soon give way. I looked at Richelieu
again, but he had returned to the princess.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; I muttered, &#8220;we must stay in this
devil of a hole, then, it seems,&#8221; and I folded my
arms and walked moodily towards the door.</p>

<p>But I paused as I felt a light touch upon my
elbow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, M. de Brancas,&#8221; murmured Louise,
&#8220;when M. le Duc told us that he had not seen you,
that you had not returned to his hotel after the
theatre last night, but that the note had been delivered,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
I suspected a trap. I implored him to go,
but he would not listen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can well believe it,&#8221; I groaned. &#8220;He is
capable of any madness.&#8221;</p>

<p>I heard the door below splitting. In another
moment the soldiers would be upon us.</p>

<p>&#8220;And conceive our anxiety for you, monsieur,&#8221;
continued Louise, in a lower tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;For me?&#8221; I cried. &#8220;And you have then forgiven
me, Louise?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Jean!&#8221; and my arms were around her,
&#8220;did you think these tears were for Richelieu?&#8221;</p>

<p>With a crash the door gave way, and I heard the
tramp of heavy feet upon the stairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, my friend,&#8221; said Richelieu, and together
we left the room, the door of which he
closed after us.</p>

<p>The guards were already half-way up the stairs,
but paused at the sight of us standing there in the
shadow above them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-evening, gentlemen,&#8221; said Richelieu.
&#8220;May I ask your errand in this house?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis Richelieu!&#8221; cried a voice, which I recognized
as that of H&eacute;rault. &#8220;Wait a moment, men.&#8221;</p>

<p>He pushed his way to the front of the crowd.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>&#8220;Our errand here concerns only yourself, M.
le Duc,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We are charged to arrest you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And of what am I accused?&#8221; asked Richelieu.</p>

<p>&#8220;You were ordered to join your regiment at
Bayonne, monsieur,&#8221; answered H&eacute;rault, &#8220;and you
are now in Paris. That is your offence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis not a great one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But we must arrest you nevertheless, monsieur.
Do you surrender, or shall we be compelled to take
you by force?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Monsieur,&#8221; cried Richelieu, &#8220;you have just
said that your mission here concerns only myself.
If I accompany you without resistance have I your
word that no one else in this house will be molested?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have my word, monsieur,&#8221; answered H&eacute;rault,
who had not perceived me in the dim light
of the hall and thought only that Richelieu was
trying to protect the princess.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, do not do this; we may yet escape!&#8221; I
implored, but the duke silenced me with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;On those conditions I surrender,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I
will come down to you, M. H&eacute;rault,&#8221; and he
started to descend, but paused as he perceived a
sudden commotion at the door.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>&#8220;A messenger for M. H&eacute;rault!&#8221; cried some one.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked H&eacute;rault.</p>

<p>A man forced his way up the staircase and to
H&eacute;rault&#8217;s side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bernin,&#8221; cried the latter, &#8220;what are you doing
here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have to report, monsieur,&#8221; he said, humbly,
&#8220;that my prisoner has escaped.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Escaped!&#8221; exclaimed H&eacute;rault. &#8220;Impossible!
How could one unarmed man defeat six guards
and wade through twenty more?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This was not a man, it was a devil,&#8221; declared
Bernin. &#8220;He locked us in his bedroom like so
many pigs, having first decoyed us there to show
us how to play a wonderful game. He broke open
the window and dropped forty feet into the Seine.
We had the door down in a moment, but he was
gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And where did he go?&#8221; cried H&eacute;rault. &#8220;Tell
me that, Bernin?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Alas, I do not know, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I can relieve your anxiety on that
score, M. H&eacute;rault,&#8221; I said, descending to a lower
step. &#8220;I wish you a very good-evening, monsieur,&#8221;
and I bowed politely.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>He stared at me with open mouth, as though unable
to believe his eyes. Some one brought a
torch, which cast a red glow over the hallway and
threw into relief the faces of the soldiers looking
up at us. But he was a man accustomed to astonishments,
and he soon pulled himself together.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will pardon my surprise, M. de Brancas,&#8221;
he said, at last. &#8220;You seem to be possessed of an
amazing agility. May I ask how you entered
here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By the door,&#8221; I answered, still smiling, and
rejoicing that it was my turn, &#8220;an instant before
your men appeared at the end of the street, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>He gazed at me for a moment longer as I smiled
down into his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, M. de Brancas,&#8221; he said, at last, mounting
to the step where I stood, &#8220;give me your hand.
By my soul, you are a brave man and I admire you.
You must some day show me this game with which
you beguiled my soldiers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With pleasure,&#8221; I laughed. &#8220;It is an excellent
game.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what is it called?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Perhaps
I already know it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>&#8220;I do not think so, monsieur. It is called
&#8216;Prisoner&#8217;s Chase&#8217;. If properly played, in the end
the prisoner escapes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you are free, M. de Brancas,&#8221; said H&eacute;rault,
still looking at me. &#8220;My orders were to
detain you only until Richelieu was safely arrested.
As he has agreed to accompany us, we need not
trouble you further. I see now,&#8221; he added, &#8220;why
he was so anxious to have no one else here molested.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Must it be, monsieur?&#8221; I cried, turning to
Richelieu. &#8220;Is this the only way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the only way,&#8221; he answered; and then,
turning to H&eacute;rault, &#8220;Monsieur, will you permit
me to say a word in private to my friend?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There will be no attempt to escape?&#8221; asked
H&eacute;rault, hesitating.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have my word, monsieur,&#8221; said Richelieu,
proudly.</p>

<p>&#8220;True,&#8221; and H&eacute;rault thought for a moment.
&#8220;M. le Duc, I will withdraw with my men to the
stairfoot. In three minutes you will descend alone
and without your sword. Is it agreed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is agreed,&#8221; said Richelieu, and H&eacute;rault and
his men went down the stairs.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>&#8220;All this amounts to nothing, de Brancas,&#8221; said
Richelieu, in a low tone. &#8220;This regency will not
last a week, and so the worst that can happen to
me will be a week in prison. What I fear is that
Charlotte, over-estimating my danger, will be
moved to make some ridiculous sacrifice for me.
Of course, you cannot tell her of the conspiracy,
but make her believe, if possible, that I am in no
danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall try, monsieur,&#8221; I faltered.</p>

<p>&#8220;And tell Madame du Maine,&#8221; he continued,
rapidly, &#8220;that everything is prepared at Bayonne
and that my absence will make no difference. My
men know my wishes, the town council is ready,
and the city will declare against Orleans.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, I will tell her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And now, good-by, my friend,&#8221; and Richelieu
took my hand. &#8220;You have already performed
miracles of valor in my behalf, and that I am a
prisoner now is my own fault and not yours. I
shall never forget it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He drew his sword, threw it far from him, and
passed down the stairs under the red glow of the
torches to the captors who awaited him, his head
proudly erect, his lips smiling. The lights threw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
flaring shadows in every corner, but their bearers
stood in perfect silence, with upturned faces, admiring,
breathless. Could I have known what
was to follow ere I should see that courtly form
again, even then, I swear it, I would have rushed
down sword in hand and cut our way to freedom.
But it was not to be.</p>

<p>I stood there motionless till the tramp of horses
died away in the distance. Then I opened the
door and entered.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have heard all,&#8221; said Louise. &#8220;Richelieu
is arrested.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I am here,&#8221; I added, gloomily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Believe me, we do not blame you in the least,
M. de Brancas,&#8221; and Mlle. de Valois smiled
through her tears. &#8220;You did more than any other
man could have done, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In any event, there is nothing more for us to
do here,&#8221; I said. &#8220;Let us go. But first, let me tell
you, mademoiselle, that Richelieu entreats you not
to over-estimate his danger, and not to worry on
his account, since he believes he will be free in a
week&#8217;s time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is trying to deceive me, monsieur,&#8221; and
she looked at me questioningly. &#8220;You yourself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
know how little ground there is for such a
hope.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is something which I cannot tell you,
mademoiselle,&#8221; I answered, &#8220;but which will undoubtedly
secure his release if it results fortunately.
That is true, believe me,&#8221; and without daring to
say more, I opened the door and led the way down
the staircase.</p>

<p>We were soon in the street, and I accompanied
them to the little door opening on the Rue de
Richelieu through which the duke had evaded the
regent&#8217;s first trap. They bade me adieu, and
Louise gave my hand a little pressure as she left
me, but not even that could lift me from the
gloom into which I had fallen. I returned slowly
to the Rue des Saints P&egrave;res. Jacques was awaiting
me, and paled visibly at sight of my downcast face.</p>

<p>&#8220;What has happened, monsieur?&#8221; he asked in
a frightened whisper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Richelieu has been arrested. He is again in
the Bastille,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you will get him out, will you not, monsieur?&#8221;
and the anxious fellow looked at me piteously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will try, rest assured of that,&#8221; I said, and I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
smiled, with tears in my eyes, at his faith in
me.</p>

<p>Sleep was long in coming to my eyes that night.
If the conspiracy succeeded, Richelieu was saved.
But if it failed, what then? I shuddered at the
thought, for I remembered the regent&#8217;s last words
to me and the look which had accompanied them.
At last I fell into a troubled sleep, in which I saw
again that graceful figure descending the staircase
under the red glare of the torches. And then the
scene changed. There was the same sea of eager,
admiring faces watching in breathless silence, but
the figure they watched was going up instead of
down, and on the platform to which it was mounting
there stood a block and a masked man with an
axe. And the red glow over it all was blood.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br />


<small>A DAY OF FRUITLESS EFFORT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">I arose</span> in the morning weary and unrefreshed.
My forebodings had increased rather than diminished,
and I determined to lose no time in doing
all I could in Richelieu&#8217;s behalf. Jacques&#8217;s gloomy
face reflected my own, and I ate my breakfast in
silence, for I had not the heart to tell him how
little hope I really had and how helpless I felt.</p>

<p>I left the house and went first to the Tuileries.
Although the hour was still early Madame du
Maine was already at work, as I had no doubt she
would be, and I was shown into her presence. As
usual, Mlle. de Launay was with her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you heard of the arrest of M. de Richelieu,
madame?&#8221; I inquired, as soon as we had exchanged
greetings.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is the duke, then, arrested again, and for
what?&#8221; she asked, quickly and with visible uneasiness.</p>

<p>&#8220;For nothing connected with your plan, madame,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
but merely for being in Paris against the
orders of the regent.&#8221;</p>

<p>I saw that she breathed again.</p>

<p>&#8220;And when was he in Paris?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;I
thought him at Bayonne.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was in Paris last night, madame.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what was he doing in Paris?&#8221; she questioned,
sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;He came upon some private business, madame.
He was surprised by a company of guards and
taken to the Bastille.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some love-affair, I do not doubt,&#8221; she said,
bitterly. &#8220;Richelieu should learn to allow his
private affairs to wait when they interfere with
matters of greater moment, as he must have known
they would do in this case.&#8221;</p>

<p>I glanced at the duchess in surprise, for this was
the first indication of selfishness I had detected in
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;He expressly charged me to tell you, madame,&#8221;
I said, a little stiffly, &#8220;that his arrest would make
no difference to your plans so far as Bayonne is
concerned. The regiment and the town council
are ready and understand perfectly what is expected
of them.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>&#8220;Then all is well,&#8221; cried the duchess.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon me, madame,&#8221; I objected, &#8220;but all is
not well. M. de Richelieu is in the Bastille.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, he will not remain there long. In a week
we shall have control of Paris, and the doors will
be opened for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But if the conspiracy fails, madame?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In that case, monsieur,&#8221; said the duchess,
haughtily, &#8220;we shall none of us be in better case
than is M. de Richelieu at this moment. But who
talks of failure? We shall not fail. We cannot
fail,&#8221; and I thought as I looked at her that with a
few more leaders such as she failure would indeed
be impossible. But one woman against all France
was heavy odds.</p>

<p>&#8220;Believe me, M. de Brancas,&#8221; she continued, in
a gentler tone, &#8220;I can at this time do nothing for
our friend. I have no influence with the regent,
and a word from me would do Richelieu more
harm than good.&#8221;</p>

<p>I recognized the justness of her words, and said
as much.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything I can do shall be done, rest assured
of that,&#8221; she added. &#8220;By the way, monsieur, I
shall look for you at my salon to-night. We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
have need that all our friends should gather to
us.&#8221;</p>

<p>I promised to be there, and withdrew with a
heavy heart. I paused to consider what next to do.
If I were to go to the Bastille, I reflected, I might
have opportunity to see the prisoner and exchange
a word of comfort with him. Anything was better
than doing nothing, so I set off towards the dismal
old prison. I reached it in the course of half an
hour and asked the sentry at the outer gate if I
might see M. de Maison-Rouge.</p>

<p>&#8220;What name, monsieur?&#8221; he inquired.</p>

<p>I gave him my name, and he summoned a messenger,
who returned in a few moments saying I
was to enter. The gate opened and I was again
in the outer court-yard.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know the way,&#8221; I said to the messenger, who
started to accompany me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nevertheless I must go with you, monsieur,&#8221;
he replied. &#8220;It is the rule.&#8221;</p>

<p>I made no further objection, and he led me to
the presence of the governor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, M. de Brancas,&#8221; and he smiled as I entered,
&#8220;you are early, but I was expecting
you.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>&#8220;Doubtless,&#8221; I answered, dryly. &#8220;But tell me,
may I see Richelieu?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I regret to say that you may not, monsieur.
The regent has sent me a special order to allow the
duke to see no one and to hold communication with
no one.&#8221;</p>

<p>A chill ran through me at this new evidence of
the regent&#8217;s purpose.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what inference do you draw from this
order, monsieur?&#8221; I inquired, after a moment&#8217;s
gloomy thought.</p>

<p>Maison-Rouge shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not for me to draw inferences,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;I obey orders without questioning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And how does he take his imprisonment?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He seems to be in good spirits,&#8221; and Maison-Rouge
smiled. &#8220;In fact, I have never seen him
otherwise, and he was here for over a year when
he was younger. I use him as kindly as the regulations
permit. He has his old room, which he
seems to prefer, and I have allowed him to send
to his hotel for some additional clothing and furniture.
I can do nothing more, monsieur, even were
I so inclined. There are many in the Bastille who
are not so fortunate.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>There was nothing more to be said, and I left
the place, the messenger, who was waiting outside
the door, accompanying me to the gate. As I
passed through it, I reflected that I might perhaps
be able to catch a glimpse of Richelieu at his cell
window, and I turned to the right along the lofty
outer wall and the deep ditch which rendered approach
to it more difficult. The great prison had
an indescribably threatening and gloomy air even
under the rays of the noonday sun, and my heart
trembled within me at the thought of the scores
of helpless men behind those massive walls; of
the miserable wretches lying in the oubliettes,
thrown there, perhaps, by a royal caprice which had
forgotten the prisoner before it had forgotten its
wrath, and for whom death was the only release.
Truly, there are worse things than death, and it
were better for Richelieu to lose his head than to
go mad in one of those reeking torture chambers.</p>

<p>A narrow path ran along the top of the embankment,
and I followed this until I reached the end
of the outer wall. Within was the dreary Tower
du Puits in which we had been confined, and my
eyes sought out the window of Richelieu&#8217;s cell
and of my own just above it. At this distance they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
seemed mere port-holes in the great wall, and owing
to the darkness within, I found that I could
not see the prisoner, even if he were standing at
his window. But he might be able to recognize
me, and I took my handkerchief from my pocket
and waved it in the air. In a moment I was
rejoiced to see an answering gleam of white between
the bars of the window, and I knew that he
had seen me. I waved again and yet again, and as
I did so heard hurrying feet behind me, and a hand
was laid roughly on my shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will accompany us, monsieur,&#8221; said a
voice.</p>

<p>I turned sharply and saw three men in the uniform
of the Bastille guards. Each carried a musket.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it now?&#8221; I asked in amazement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Monsieur knows or should know,&#8221; answered
the man, &#8220;that all signalling to the prisoners is
prohibited under pain of imprisonment. Put up
your handkerchief and follow me, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>I followed without a word, but inwardly cursing
my ill fortune, and for the second time that morning
the outer gate opened to admit me, this time
without question. I was led straight to the governor&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
office, a sentry on either side. Maison-Rouge
looked at me with astonishment as I entered,
and heard with evident impatience the statement
of the guard who had arrested me.</p>

<p>&#8220;That will do,&#8221; he said, as he concluded his
story, and as the door closed behind them he turned
to me. &#8220;M. de Brancas, I need not tell you that
your offence is a serious one, and that many persons
have been imprisoned for much less.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had desired only to let Richelieu know that
his friends had not forgot him,&#8221; I protested.</p>

<p>&#8220;The regent has ordered that no communication
be held with him,&#8221; said Maison-Rouge,
sternly, &#8220;and I tell you plainly, monsieur, that at
another attempt of this kind he will be placed in
a cell where he will not only not see his friends,
but where he will also never see the light of day.
I intend taking no chance of offending the regent
a second time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, monsieur,&#8221; I said, reflecting that
anything was better than that Richelieu should be
plunged into an oubliette; &#8220;as for me, I promise
to hold no further communication with him until
the regent permits it. Am I, also, a prisoner?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, M. de Brancas,&#8221; he answered, not unkindly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
&#8220;I do not intend to imprison you. I wish
merely to warn you. You may go.&#8221;</p>

<p>The messenger was waiting, and I left the Bastille
for the second time, to the obvious astonishment
of the sentries at the outer gate. As it clanged
shut behind me I decided that there was only
one thing more I could do, to see the regent and
endeavor to mitigate his anger against Richelieu.
I had deferred this to the last, for I had little hope
of success, and indeed thought it not unlikely that
I should leave his presence escorted by a squad of
soldiers; but everything else had failed me, and I
turned towards the Palais Royal. Two o&#8217;clock
was striking as I reached the Rue St. Honor&eacute;,
which was crowded with the usual throng of carriages
and pedestrians. I pushed my way through
these, meeting no one whom I knew, and soon
reached the palace.</p>

<p>I was shown into a large antechamber where a
score of people were awaiting an audience, and
among them I perceived H&eacute;rault. He was walking
up and down with a gentleman whom I did
not know, but who wore the uniform of a captain
of the guards. In a moment H&eacute;rault perceived
me, and came towards me, holding out his hand.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>&#8220;Good-day, M. de Brancas,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;I am
glad to see you. I trust you suffered no ill effects
from your bath of yesterday evening?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;None whatever, monsieur,&#8221; I answered,
smiling, for I liked the hearty good humor of the
man, and perceived that my liking was returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;M. de Brancas,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;allow me to
present my friend the Marquis d&#8217;Ancenis, captain
of the guards. I was just relating to him the
details of your leap into the Seine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In faith, &#8217;twas worth relating,&#8221; declared
d&#8217;Ancenis, warmly. &#8220;I know no other man who
could have done it so neatly, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>I bowed my thanks.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was really nothing,&#8221; I protested, &#8220;and after
all accomplished nothing, since the friend whom I
wished to rescue is at this moment in the Bastille.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, well, one cannot accomplish miracles, monsieur,&#8221;
said d&#8217;Ancenis, and I looked with pleasure
at his smiling face, which reminded me of Richelieu.
&#8220;Do you know, you have become famous
during your brief residence in Paris. Only last
night I heard a handsome woman discoursing on
your many feats.&#8221;</p>

<p>My heart leaped within me.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>&#8220;And may I ask the lady&#8217;s name, monsieur?&#8221; I
stammered.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twas Madame du Maine,&#8221; said d&#8217;Ancenis,
and my heart sank again, for I had hoped to hear
another name. &#8220;We had a little dinner together
with half a dozen others, and the duchess was the
life of it. She is a wonderful woman, only I fancied
last night that she was looking careworn.&#8221;</p>

<p>I thought to myself that if he knew what I knew
he would not wonder that she looked careworn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;she told us a story concerning
you which seemed to me well-nigh impossible.
What do you think it was, H&eacute;rault?&#8221; he
asked, turning to the latter. &#8220;It was that this
devil of a fellow, together with Richelieu, not only
managed to escape from the Bastille the other
night, but after keeping an appointment killed two
or three of the regent&#8217;s attendants, and then actually
forced their way back into their cells, leaving
no trace of their passage, before the regent could
get to the Bastille. When he reached there they
were asleep in their cells, all the gates were barred,
and not a sentry had seen them pass. What think
you of that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It sounds like a story from the &#8216;Thousand and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
One Nights,&#8217;&#8221; and H&eacute;rault looked at me questioningly.
&#8220;But is it true, monsieur?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The facts were very much as M. d&#8217;Ancenis
says, though I have never told the story,&#8221; and I
smiled at the astonishment of the two men.</p>

<p>&#8220;But how was this miracle accomplished?&#8221;
asked H&eacute;rault.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, do not ask him that, H&eacute;rault,&#8221; cried
d&#8217;Ancenis, gayly. &#8220;He may, perchance, have need
to work it again some time, and as for me, I hope
it will again succeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I had known you were a magician of that
sort, monsieur,&#8221; laughed H&eacute;rault, &#8220;I should have
placed twenty guards in your room instead of six.
There might then have been three or four whom
you could not have interested in that game of
yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>He would have said more, but an usher interrupted
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;The regent awaits the Marquis d&#8217;Ancenis and
M. H&eacute;rault,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The two hurried after him and disappeared
through a door at the farther end of the room. I
walked up and down impatiently, for I knew no
one else in the antechamber, and as the moments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
passed I wondered what business of importance
it was which kept them so long with the regent.
It was fully half an hour before they reappeared,
and a glance at their faces told me that something
of moment had occurred. They merely nodded to
me as they passed, and hurried from the room.
As I was reflecting on their singular behavior, a
page brought me a message.</p>

<p>&#8220;The regent regrets that he cannot see you to-day,
monsieur,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He is very busy with
affairs of state.&#8221;</p>

<p>Well, perhaps he was busy, but I felt my apprehension
deepen as I left the palace and returned
slowly to the Hotel de Richelieu. There was
nothing more to be done, at least for that day,
but perhaps the morrow would bring some hope
with it. One glance at my face told Jacques of the
ill success of my efforts, but he bravely concealed
his disappointment. He told me that Richelieu
had sent for certain articles of clothing and furniture,
from which he argued that his imprisonment
could not be very rigorous. I had not the heart to
tell him of my grave fears and the reasons for
them, and ate my dinner in silence.</p>

<p>I spent the half-hour following before the fire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
reviewing the situation, but look at it how I might,
I could find little of comfort in it. If the conspiracy
succeeded, everything would be well, but a
haunting fear possessed me, a belief that the regent
knew of it, and that, to use H&eacute;rault&#8217;s words
of the day before, he was playing with us as a cat
plays with a mouse, only to crush us more completely
in the end.</p>

<p>Eight o&#8217;clock sounded as I sat there musing,
and I remembered with a start that I had promised
Madame du Maine to be present at her salon that
evening. I had little desire to mix in that gay
company, but a promise was a promise, and I
sprang from my chair, added a few touches to my
toilet, and, leaving the house, was soon at the
Tuileries.</p>

<small>THE REGENT SHOWS HIS HAND</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> place was more brilliant than I had ever
seen it. The room was crowded from end to end
by a throng of richly dressed people, from whom
every instant came bursts of laughter, following
some witty sally,&mdash;only to me, whose ears were
perhaps unduly critical, the laughter sounded
forced and unnatural, sometimes almost hysterical.
Mlle. de Launay appeared to be everywhere at
once, and left smiles behind her wherever she went.
Truly, a wonderful woman, but to me her activity
seemed feverish. The duchess, as usual, held her
court at the farther end of the room, and the crowd
about her was so dense that I despaired of getting
to her, and paused to look about me. I saw
that all of her political satellites were present.
Polignac was the centre of one interested group,
Chancel was declaiming his latest satire to another,
Malesieu was explaining the meaning of a Greek
phrase to a third. There were many persons present
whom I had never seen before, notably a number<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
of gentlemen elegantly dressed but not in the
latest Paris mode, whom I immediately set down
as provincial. The duchess and her maid withdrew
before I could get a word with either of them,
and I joined the group about Chancel. But I
found his satire little to my liking, for it was
merely a brutal tirade against the regent, and contained
accusations which I felt certain even Chancel
himself knew to be untrue.</p>

<p>As the moments passed I noticed that the provincial
gentlemen, as well as the other important
personages present, were approached by a page and
taken one by one to the room into which Madame
du Maine had retired, and that when they came
out again there was fire in their eyes and a new intelligence
in their faces. Only once was there any
break in this stream of persons entering and leaving
the cabinet. The page appeared to be seeking
some one whom he could not find.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you seen the Abb&eacute; Brigaut this evening,
monsieur?&#8221; I heard him inquire of the gentleman
at my elbow, and the latter replied in the negative.
He took this answer back to the duchess, and a
moment later reappeared to conduct others of
those present to that mysterious door. I was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
racking my brain to find an explanation of this
proceeding, when the page approached me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Madame du Maine wishes to speak to you a
moment, M. de Brancas,&#8221; he said, and without
waiting for a reply, he led the way to the door
through which I had already seen so many enter.
I followed him, and in a moment the door closed
behind me. The duchess and Mlle. de Launay
were sitting at a large table littered with papers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, M. de Brancas,&#8221; cried the former as I
entered, and I saw that her eyes were bright and
her face flushed with excitement, &#8220;it is, as you see,
a gathering of the clans. To-night we are all assembled,
each to learn his part in the drama we are
about to play. You have perhaps noticed that there
are many strangers present?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have indeed noticed it, madame,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you have been wondering who they are,
have you not? Well, I will tell you, M. de Brancas.
They are representatives of half the noble
houses of Brittany, who have come to give me
personal assurance of their support. To-night,
monsieur, the threads are all in my hands, and in
five days Philip d&#8217;Orleans will no longer be regent
of France.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>The lines of care had faded from her face
and left her ten years younger. Her companion
had caught her enthusiasm, and her eyes were
sparkling in sympathy with those of the duchess.</p>

<p>&#8220;I rejoice to learn that everything goes so well,&#8221;
I said, and I felt my heart warming for these two
women who had accomplished so much. &#8220;Has
madame any commands for me? I should be most
happy to take a part in the drama, even though it
be a small one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis not a command, but a request,&#8221; she answered,
quickly. &#8220;You can be of great service
to me if you will, M. de Brancas. The arrest of
Richelieu takes a cog out of the wheel, and in
order that the machine may move with perfect
certainty and smoothness I wish you to replace
that cog. In a word, monsieur, what I desire is
a personal representative at Bayonne, a man whom
I can trust and in whose courage I have faith.
You are that man, M. de Brancas,&#8221;&mdash;I bowed at
the compliment,&mdash;&#8220;and I ask you to go to represent
me at Bayonne.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will go with the greatest pleasure, madame,&#8221;
I answered; &#8220;only will the good people of Bayonne
have in me the same faith which you have?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>&#8220;You will take papers with you which will inspire
them with faith, monsieur,&#8221; she answered,
&#8220;and I believe that after they have known you a
few days even the papers will be unnecessary.
They will be handed to you presently, for I wish
you to set out to-night. At ten o&#8217;clock a horse will
be waiting for you just without the little gate at
the back of the Tuileries, which you already know,
as you passed through it the other day with Mlle.
de Launay. Here is a key to the gate. At ten
o&#8217;clock we will give you the papers; you will go
out at the back of the palace without attracting
attention. You will open the gate and lock it after
you. At the other side you will find your horse.
You will mount the horse and set off for Bayonne.
You will find changes of horses awaiting you at
Orleans, Tours, Poitiers, Angoul&ecirc;me, Bordeaux,
and Rion. Where, in detail, you are to look for
these horses will be specified in the written instructions
which will be given you, since you might
forget if I were merely to tell you. And I beg of
you do not spare the horses. Upon reaching Bayonne,
you will go at once to the address which you
will find in the papers. All of the papers will then
be opened and read in your presence, and you will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
see that the instructions contained in them are
carried out. Do you understand, monsieur?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perfectly,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you agree?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, madame.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thank you, monsieur,&#8221; and she gave me her
hand very prettily. &#8220;I knew that I should not
call upon you in vain. Adieu, monsieur. When
we meet again I hope to be in a position to advance
your fortunes.&#8221;</p>

<p>It wanted but half an hour of ten o&#8217;clock when
I returned to the outer room. I was apparently
the last one to whom the duchess had instructions
to give, for she soon followed me, accompanied by
her maid. The room was still crowded, and no
one showed any disposition to leave. The knowledge
that the time for action was not far distant
charged the air with excitement, and men looked
at men with set lips and shining eyes. There was
no mistaking the determination to strike the regency
a blow from which it could not recover, and
for the first time I began to be really confident of
success.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is St. Aulaire?&#8221; I heard Mlle. de
Launay inquire.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>&#8220;I did not invite him this evening,&#8221; answered
the duchess. &#8220;He knows nothing of our plans.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis not like him to await an invitation, however,&#8221;
observed the girl. &#8220;Brigaut is also still
missing, is he not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has doubtless been detained. He has much
to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned to the courtiers who were crowding
around her, when there came a little tumult at the
door, and I saw a thin, old man pushing his way
through the crowd. At a glance I recognized St.
Aulaire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, madame,&#8221; he cried, as he neared the
duchess, &#8220;the most astonishing things have been
happening in Paris this evening. Three or four
hours ago, H&eacute;rault and his men arrested a fellow
called Abb&eacute; Bri&mdash;Bri&mdash;I forget the name. Does
any one here happen to know the name of a certain
adventurer which begins with Bri?&#8221; he continued,
appealing to the group about the duchess.</p>

<p>A silence as of death had fallen upon the room.
Nearly every man within sound of St. Aulaire&#8217;s
voice knew that the Abb&eacute; Brigaut was interested
in the conspiracy, and was, indeed, one of the most
trusted of Madame du Maine&#8217;s agents in Paris,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
but not one of them uttered a word. St. Aulaire
found himself looking into faces of stone.</p>

<p>&#8220;But of course you do not,&#8221; he rattled on, after
a moment. &#8220;No one here would know him.
Nevertheless, it is a most amusing story. It seems
that this abb&eacute; has a secretary, and this secretary, of
course, has a mistress. Last night he had an appointment
with his mistress, which, it appears, he
did not keep,&mdash;in which he was greatly to blame.
This morning he called to make his excuses, and
told the girl that his master had kept him awake
all night preparing a lot of papers which were to
be sent to Spain.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that word a shiver ran through the listeners,
and the duchess became livid. By a supreme effort
she smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, well, monsieur,&#8221; she said, &#8220;continue. We
find the story very interesting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; continued St. Aulaire, who did not
often find so attentive an audience and who needed
no encouragement to proceed, &#8220;the girl, of course,
was an agent of H&eacute;rault. All girls of that class
are. It is the price they pay for the protection of
the police. So she told a gendarme about the Abb&eacute;
Brigaut&#8217;s correspondence with Spain. The gendarme<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
told H&eacute;rault, H&eacute;rault told Dubois, Dubois
told the regent, and there you are. A few hours
later a company of guards surrounded the house
of this abb&eacute;&mdash;who, it seems, is not really an abb&eacute;,
after all&mdash;and took him to the Bastille, where he
is now comfortably lodged. His papers, of course,
were carefully gathered up and handed over to
Dubois.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And is that all?&#8221; asked the duchess, who had
bitten her lips until they were red with blood in
the effort to retain her composure.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, that is only the beginning,&#8221; cried St. Aulaire,
enjoying immensely the sensation he was
creating and little comprehending how profound
it was. &#8220;It seems that Dubois and the regent
found much to interest them in the abb&eacute;&#8217;s papers.
It is said at the Palais Royal, where I was but a
moment ago, that they discovered proofs of some
ridiculous Spanish plot, I know not what; but, at
any rate, they sent H&eacute;rault to arrest the Spanish
minister, Prince Cellamare himself. There is big
game for you! They tell me that he was completely
surprised&mdash;trust H&eacute;rault for that&mdash;and
made no resistance.&#8221;</p>

<p>St. Aulaire paused from sheer want of breath.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
Every one was looking into his neighbor&#8217;s
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; said the duchess, in a hard voice,
&#8220;it seems that we are to be too late. I would
recommend that you leave here as quickly as possible,
as M. H&eacute;rault will probably not long delay
paying me a visit.&#8221;</p>

<p>Even as they turned to go there was a tramp of
feet at the door, which swung open, giving a
glimpse of armed men beyond. But only two men
entered. They were H&eacute;rault and the Marquis
d&#8217;Ancenis. Without glancing to the right or left,
and with an admirable composure, they advanced
straight to the duchess along the lane which was
opened for them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Madame du Maine,&#8221; said d&#8217;Ancenis, bowing,
&#8220;I regret to inform you that you are under arrest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What, captain!&#8221; cried the duchess, and I could
not but admire the brave manner in which she took
the blow, &#8220;you dine with me one evening and
arrest me the next? Is not that ungallant?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis a disagreeable duty, madame,&#8221; answered
d&#8217;Ancenis, &#8220;but one which must be performed,
nevertheless. Let no one leave the room,&#8221; he added
sharply, in a louder tone, hearing a movement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
behind him. But it was no one trying to escape,&mdash;every
one seemed too nearly paralyzed to think of
that, even had it been possible. It was only the
Cardinal de Polignac, intriguer, liar, and arrant
coward, who had tumbled in a heap on the floor,
completely overcome by terror. He was pushed
to one side with scant ceremony and left to recover
as best he might.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am at your orders, monsieur,&#8221; said Madame
du Maine, proudly, and d&#8217;Ancenis bowed again.</p>

<p>H&eacute;rault returned to the entrance and ordered
in a company of the guards, whom he posted at
all the doors, while d&#8217;Ancenis prepared to take a
list of all the people in the room. This occupied
some time, and while it was in progress I again
gained the side of Madame du Maine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Permit me to compliment you, madame,&#8221; I said
in a low tone, &#8220;upon the heroic manner in which
you withstand this reverse. It is magnificent.&#8221;</p>

<p>The duchess looked at me with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps all is not yet lost, monsieur,&#8221; she said,
glancing quickly around to see that no one else
could hear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet lost?&#8221; and I looked at her in amazement.
&#8220;I do not understand, madame.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>&#8220;Can I trust you?&#8221; she asked, looking at me a
moment. &#8220;Yes, I think I can. At four o&#8217;clock
this afternoon, monsieur, the Duc d&#8217;Orleans, accompanied
only by three or four gentlemen, left
Paris to visit the king at Versailles, to lay before
him, I do not doubt, the details of our plans and to
get his signature to certain papers which Orleans
might himself hesitate to enforce without the
royal approval. St. Aulaire was mistaken in saying
that the regent was in the city this evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What then, madame?&#8221; I asked. &#8220;I confess
that I am still in the dark.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At nine o&#8217;clock this evening the regent was to
leave Versailles to return to Paris. Two hours
later he will arrive at that part of the road near
St. Cloud where it passes through a strip of woodland.
At that point he will disappear. He will
enter the wood at one side, but he will never come
out at the other. He will vanish as though the
earth had opened and swallowed him. It is a detail
of the plan which, until this moment, I have kept to
myself, and of which I am certain the police know
nothing. I was arranging a pleasant little surprise
for our confederates, for with Orleans out of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
way what serious opposition could there be to
Philip of Spain? Ah, well, it seems that it is this
detail which is to save us, and which may yet make
Philip of Spain regent of France. You understand
now, monsieur?&#8221;</p>

<p>I gazed in amazement at this extraordinary
woman, who permitted nothing to stand in the way
of her ambition.</p>

<p>&#8220;But that is assassination,&#8221; I gasped, at last.</p>

<p>The duchess looked at me coolly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Call it what you please, M. de Brancas,&#8221; she
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, madame, it is something to which no gentleman
could consent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you presume to give me a lesson in honor,
monsieur?&#8221; she demanded, haughtily, though still
preserving the low tone in which the entire conversation
had been conducted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, madame,&#8221; I said, &#8220;you do not understand.
Your standards of honor are different from those
of a man. To a woman everything is permitted&mdash;almost
everything, for even a woman will not break
her word if she be honorable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what then, monsieur?&#8221; she asked, looking
at me in astonishment.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>&#8220;Simply this, madame,&#8221; and I gave her look for
look: &#8220;I do not consent to this assassination.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You do not consent?&#8221; she hissed, her eyes
blazing with anger. &#8220;And pray who asks you to
consent, monsieur? I do not see that it is any
concern of yours. Do you mean that you, who
prate so prettily of honor, will betray me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, madame,&#8221; I answered, &#8220;I shall not betray
you,&mdash;not even to save the regent from assassination.
What you have told me in confidence I shall
tell no one. Only I shall save the regent if I can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you can,&#8221; she sneered. &#8220;That is well said.
Unassisted, M. de Brancas, I defy you to save the
regent.&#8221;</p>

<p>I looked at her once again but said nothing.
Then I left her side. D&#8217;Ancenis was still busy
taking the names of the prisoners. A group of
guards lounged at each door. I considered a moment.
If I could reach the horse which had been
waiting for me since ten o&#8217;clock outside the little
gate at the back of the palace I might yet be in
time to warn the regent. Clearly, that was the
only thing to be done, since I could not betray the
duchess.</p>

<p>I sauntered carelessly towards the group of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
guards who stood at the entrance of the hall which
led to the rear of the building. There were six of
them, and they were chatting among themselves.
I saw with satisfaction that the hall was dark. I
was within three feet of them, and still they did
not suspect me. I gathered myself for a spring.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take care, gentlemen,&#8221; cried the shrill voice
of the duchess, &#8220;M. de Brancas is going to escape!&#8221;</p>

<p>But she was too late, for even as she spoke I
sprang at the guards, hurled back two that barred
the way, and disappeared into the darkness of the
hall. They were thrown into confusion for a moment,
and in that moment I reached the rear door
and felt with joy that it yielded to my touch. As I
slammed it after me a fusillade of shots rang out
in the hallway, but I was in the court. Blessing
the chance which had made me familiar with the
place, I hastened towards the little gate, found it,
and inserted the key in the lock. I heard the door
behind me open and a chorus of excited cries.</p>

<p>&#8220;There he is!&#8221; yelled some one. &#8220;He is escaping!
Fire!&#8221;</p>

<p>But I had the gate open and was in the street
beyond. An agony of apprehension seized me.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
Suppose the horse should not be there. Suppose
I should not find it in time. Yes, there it was,
stamping its feet impatiently in the darkness. I
reached it and with my sword cut the rope with
which it was fastened just as my pursuers poured
through the gate into the little street. In an instant
I was in the saddle, without taking time to
sheathe my sword, and the horse was off like a
flash. There was a roar of muskets and I felt a
sharp pain in my left shoulder, but my horse kept
on and turned the corner into the Rue d&#8217;Echelle.
I swayed in the saddle, but the shock passed, and
in a moment I was riding firmly, my heart leaping
at the rapid motion. And I set my teeth together
as I determined, come what might, to save the
regent.</p>

<small>A RIDE THROUGH THE NIGHT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> streets were still filled with people, kept
abroad apparently by rumors of the Spanish plot,
and I was compelled to draw rein and go at a
slower gait as I turned into the Rue St. Louis.
Skirting the quays and crossing the river, I was
soon in the suburbs of Paris and comparatively
safe from pursuit. Here the extreme darkness delayed
me as the crowds had in the busier portion
of the city, but I knew that the distance to St.
Cloud was only about six miles and that the regent
could not reach the trap that had been set for him
for an hour at least. So I gave the horse his head,
confident that I should yet be able to defeat this
last resort of the duchess. As I went I wondered
who it was to whom she had committed this desperate
mission, and to this question I could find
no answer. It seemed to me an enterprise which
no gentleman would undertake, and at which even
a rogue would pause unless he were already without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
the pale of the law and so with little to lose.
But that Madame du Maine would stoop to use
such an instrument, even in her extremity, I could
not believe. So I put the problem behind me and
addressed myself to the question in hand, that of
reaching St. Cloud in time.</p>

<p>I had one morning during my first week in Paris
amused myself by loitering about the barrier and
watching the arrival and departure of carriages on
the Versailles road, and though I had never been
over this road, I had little doubt that I should
be able to find the way without difficulty. So my
heart was light as I passed through the gloomy
faubourgs, seemingly inhabited only by shadows,
which slunk along under the walls of the houses.
It was not until this moment that I realized what
the failure of the plot meant to Richelieu, but even
upon this point I soon felt more at ease, for perchance
if I succeeded in saving the regent&#8217;s life he
might be more inclined to listen to me.</p>

<p>The flare of a torch at the end of the street
brought me from my revery, and I pulled my horse
to a sudden halt and peered through the darkness
ahead. I could dimly discern the barrier, and my
heart seemed to stop as I saw that the gates were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
closed and that two sentries were pacing up and
down in front of them. It would seem that I myself
was in a trap.</p>

<p>I slid from my horse, led him to a side street,
tied him, and then moved cautiously forward to
examine the situation. Owing to the darkness I
drew quite close to the gates without being discovered,
and concealed myself behind a flight of
steps which projected from one of the houses. As
I had seen before, two sentries were guarding the
gates, and had they been alone I might have had
some chance of overpowering them. But from
the guard-house at the side came the sound of
laughter and the click of dice, and I knew that
there were others there, who, at the first cry of
alarm, would rush to the rescue of their comrades.
Force, then, was not to be thought of and strategy
was necessary. But by what strategy could I
hope to persuade these men to allow myself and my
horse to pass unquestioned, when they had doubtless
received strict orders to allow no one to leave
the city without close scrutiny? Here was an
obstacle upon which I had not counted. In times
of peace the gates were never shut, and I had
thought to pass them without difficulty, but the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
discovery of the plot must have alarmed the authorities.
At any rate, the gates were closed, and
I did not doubt that some pass-word was necessary
to open them.</p>

<p>As I was cudgelling my brains over this problem,
which seemed on its face to baffle solution, I
heard the rapid beat of a horse&#8217;s hoofs from the
direction of the city, and a moment later a horse
and rider came into view. He was riding with a
fine disregard of the dangers of the loose and uneven
pavement, and the sound of his rapid approach,
which awoke a thousand echoes along the
gloomy street, drew five or six guards from the
sentry-house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who goes there?&#8221; cried one of the men at the
gate. &#8220;Stand, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is in command here?&#8221; asked the new-comer,
reining up his horse just in time to escape
running down one of the sentries. &#8220;Quick! I
have no time to lose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am, monsieur,&#8221; answered another voice from
the direction of the house, and an officer hurried
into the light cast by the torches over the gate.
&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Orders for you, monsieur. You will read<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
them at once. And now, open the gate. I have
further advices for the regent, who is at Versailles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The pass-word, monsieur?&#8221; said the commandant
of the post.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rocroy,&#8221; answered the courier. &#8220;Quickly, let
me pass.&#8221;</p>

<p>The gates were opened on the instant, and the
rider put spurs to his horse and disappeared into
the darkness of the road without. The gates were
shut again, and the commandant retired to the
guard-house to read his orders.</p>

<p>In an instant I saw my opportunity. I crept
along the street until I reached my horse. Quickly
mounting, I turned him down a side street, and
came out again a little distance away on the road
by which the courier had come. With a touch of
the spur I urged my horse into a gallop, and approached
the gate precisely as the first courier had
done.</p>

<p>&#8220;Open!&#8221; I cried. &#8220;On the king&#8217;s service.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardieu,&#8221; growled the sentry, &#8220;it seems to me
there are many couriers passing here to-night.
Something must be afoot. The pass-word, if you
please.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>&#8220;Rocroy,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, my friend, wait a moment,&#8221; and he
placed his hand on one of the gates and half opened
it as the commandant came running from the
house, his orders still in his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold, Batard!&#8221; he cried to the sentry, &#8220;I wish
to see this gentleman.&#8221; The man paused, still
holding the gate half open.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me see,&#8221; he continued, holding the paper
up to the light and scanning it closely. &#8220;About
twenty&mdash;gray suit&mdash;gray cloak&mdash;light moustache&mdash;light
hair&mdash;mounted on black horse&mdash;&#8221; he looked
at me for a moment keenly. &#8220;You cannot pass,
monsieur,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It seems to me that you
are Monsieur de Brancas, whom I have just received
an order to arrest and hold at all hazard.
Close the gate, Batard.&#8221;</p>

<p>But I had understood before he finished. I
drove my spurs deep into the horse&#8217;s flanks, and
with one bound upset the fellow who was still
holding the half-opened gate. At the same instant
the horse struck the gate, the force of the shock
swinging it still farther open. We were through
the opening before the guards had time to realize
that I was escaping and plunged into the darkness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
without the walls. For the third time that
night I knew that I should receive a volley in the
rear, and I bent low in my saddle as the shots rang
out behind me. Luckily, the rascals were too
astonished to aim accurately, and the bullets
whistled harmlessly over me. But there might
be a pursuit, and I did not allow my horse to
slacken his pace until the barrier was far behind.</p>

<p>As I rode I reflected upon this new perfidy of
the duchess, for that she had furnished H&eacute;rault
the description which had been sent to the Versailles
gate I did not doubt, and was amazed anew
at the daring and ingenuity of this woman, who
knew how to use even her enemies in accomplishing
her ends. At last, believing myself safe from
pursuit, I drew up and looked about me. It was
lighter here than in the narrow streets of the city,
and the moon was just peeping over the horizon,
but still I could see little. I had been delayed not
less than half an hour at the barrier and knew that
I had no time to lose, so I put spurs to my horse
again and continued rapidly onward. In a few
moments I came to a place where the road forked.
Which was the road to Versailles, the right or the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
left? I did not know, and seeing no way of finding
out, chose the left at a hazard and continued
on. I had not ridden far when I saw at the side
of the road ahead of me a dim light. As I drew
nearer I perceived that it came from the window
of a low and squalid hut. Here, perhaps, I might
be able to gain the information I sought. I rode
my horse up to the door, and, drawing a pistol
from the holster, rapped with its butt.</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment within the
house, and then the door slowly opened. As it did
so, I was astonished to see that the candle which
had been burning a moment before had been extinguished.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, monsieur?&#8221; asked a voice from
the darkness within.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is this the road to Versailles?&#8221; I questioned.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, monsieur,&#8221; answered the voice, without
hesitation; &#8220;you doubtless took the wrong road
at the forks a mile back. Return there, monsieur,
and take the right-hand road. Follow it straight
ahead and it will lead you to Versailles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Many thanks,&#8221; I answered, and turned my
horse&#8217;s head. As I did so, I heard the click of a
pistol within the room.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>&#8220;Who goes to Versailles at this hour and for
what?&#8221; cried another voice, which I seemed to
recognize and yet could not place. &#8220;Hold, monsieur,&#8221;
it continued; &#8220;do not move. I have you
covered with my pistol and I never miss.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a note of braggartry in the voice
which refreshed my memory.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, it is Cartouche,&#8221; I said. &#8220;I wish you
good-evening, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And who may you be?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;You have
the best of me, monsieur?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Doubtless,&#8221; I laughed. &#8220;You meet so many
people, and usually in the dark. But you may,
perhaps, remember an encounter some nights back
with a man who was lost in Paris, and who was
saved from your rascals only by the timely arrival
of the Duc de Richelieu.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By my soul, yes,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;I have
cause to remember it, since I lost three sturdy
rogues. Are you that man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am he,&#8221; and I smiled down at the invisible
form within the doorway, for I could imagine the
expression which must be upon his face, &#8220;and I
am glad of the opportunity of a word with you.
You do not know, perhaps, that Richelieu is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
prisoner in the Bastille and that his head is in great
danger?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I did not know it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is so, nevertheless. He told me that he did
you a service once and that you have not forgotten
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is so, monsieur,&#8221; said Cartouche.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you will now have opportunity to repay
that kindness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; he assented. &#8220;If the worst comes
to the worst a rescue in the Place de Greve is not
impossible. It has been done before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And may be done again,&#8221; I cried, &#8220;if you can
muster fifty rogues who are not afraid of steel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Trust me for that,&#8221; answered Cartouche,
quietly. &#8220;I can muster a hundred such if necessary.
But why is M. de Richelieu imprisoned,
monsieur?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Simply because the regent wishes it,&#8221; I said.
&#8220;Richelieu has done nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; and Cartouche remained for a moment
thoughtful. &#8220;Well, monsieur,&#8221; he said, at last,
in a tone full of significance, &#8220;I do not believe we
shall need to have recourse to a rescue of that character.
The matter will soon adjust itself.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>&#8220;Adjust itself? But how?&#8221; I questioned, in
amazement.</p>

<p>&#8220;No matter,&#8221; and Cartouche laughed, a short
dry laugh. &#8220;Only, monsieur, should a rescue become
necessary, you may count upon me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; I said. &#8220;I shall see you again,
then, if there is need,&#8221; and I turned my horse back
in the direction from which I had come.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a moment, monsieur,&#8221; he called, with
a good-humored chuckle, coming out of the house
and putting up his pistol. &#8220;You are already on
the road to Versailles. It is one of the principles
of our business never to tell the truth if it can be
avoided. Continue straight ahead and you will
reach St. Cloud. Ten leagues farther is Versailles.&#8221;</p>

<p>I turned my horse about with a jerk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does the road run through a wood near here?&#8221;
I asked, as I took a new hold on the bridle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not half a league farther on, monsieur,&#8221; he
answered, in a surprised voice, and I was off before
he could say more. As I glanced back over
my shoulder I saw him standing there still staring
after me, and then, as though struck by a sudden
idea, turn and vanish within the cabin. I had need<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
of haste, for eleven o&#8217;clock could not be far distant.
But the horse Madame du Maine had provided was
a good one, and I laughed as I pictured to myself
how she must be tearing her hair at the thought
that it was she who had given me the means of
saving the regent. The moon had risen clear of
the trees while I was parleying with Cartouche
and flooded the country with noonday brightness.
Fearing no pitfalls in this wide and level road, I
spurred onward, peering ahead for the wood of
which Cartouche had spoken, but of which I could
see no sign. Once I thought I heard the beat of
horses&#8217; hoofs behind me, but when I turned in my
saddle I saw no one, and concluded that they were
merely the echo of my own. The minutes passed,
and finally, to my great relief, away before me I
saw that the white road seemed to disappear in the
darkness, as though cut off at the entrance to a
tunnel. This, then, was the wood, and with new
ardor, for I had begun to fear that Cartouche had
misled me, I galloped towards it. The road flew
past under my horse like some gigantic ribbon,
and in a moment I was in the shadow of the trees.</p>

<p>Here I paused. I did not know how far the
wood extended, nor did I know at what point the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
ambush had been prepared. The only thing to
be done, evidently, was to ride to the other side
and stop the regent and his party before they entered
it. I proceeded cautiously, the dust deadening
the hoofbeats of my horse, for I did not know
at what moment I myself might be greeted by a
volley from the roadside. At last, far down the
avenue ahead, I saw the road opening out into the
plain, and at the same moment I again heard the
sound of swiftly galloping horses in my rear. This
time there was no mistaking the sound, and as I
turned, I saw a troop of three or four just entering
the wood. As I looked at them the mysterious
words of Cartouche flashed into my head. Could
it be that it was to him the duchess had confided
the task of assassinating the regent, and that he
had not suspected my purpose until too late to stop
me? The thought made me drive the spurs once
more into the flanks of my horse, and as I did so
I heard again that clear, sharp whistle which Cartouche
had used once before to summon his men to
attack me. Almost before the sound had died away
under the trees there came a flash of fire from the
roadside, a ringing report, and my horse stumbled
and nearly fell, then continued slowly onward,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
limping badly. I heard the horses of my pursuers
rapidly drawing nearer, and even at that moment
I saw ahead of me down the road another little
troop approaching from the direction of Versailles,
and knew it was the regent and three or four companions.
Would I be in time? Would my horse
carry me out of the forest? The troop behind me
was dangerously near.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop, monsieur!&#8221; cried a voice, which I knew
to be that of Cartouche. &#8220;Stop or we fire!&#8221;</p>

<p>Without answering, I threw myself forward
upon my horse&#8217;s neck and again drove in the spurs.
I could hear the poor brute&#8217;s breath coming in
gasps, and from the trembling of his body I knew
he was almost done. But it was no time to spare
him, and the white road gleaming in the moonlight
just ahead was so near&mdash;so near.</p>

<p>Again Cartouche cried out for me to halt, and
again I did not answer.</p>

<p>I glanced ahead and saw that the regent&#8217;s party
had apparently heard the tramp of our horses, for
they had stopped to listen. In an instant I had
seized a pistol from the holster and fired it in the
air. They would hear the report and at least be
prepared to face the danger which threatened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
them. As my shot rang out through the still night
air I heard a savage oath behind me. There came
a crash of pistols and a great blow seemed to strike
me in the head. I reeled in the saddle, caught myself
as I was falling, and held on. The earth
seemed whirling under me, strange lights danced
before my eyes. I shook them from me with
clenched teeth; I was out in the moonlight; my
horse still staggered on. And then, as in a dream,
I saw the regent, sitting on his horse calmly in the
middle of the road.</p>

<p>&#8220;Save yourself, monsieur!&#8221; I cried. &#8220;Save
yourself! They would kill you!&#8221;</p>

<p>I felt the horse slipping from under me, the
sky grew black, something in my head seemed to
burst, and I knew no more.</p>

<small>D&#8217;ANCENIS TELLS THE STORY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">I lay</span> for some time without stirring, looking
fixedly at the window in front of me and wondering
in a vague way what had happened. I could
see the sun shining brightly on some shrubbery
outside the window. The view was stopped by a
wall, and a dull and monotonous roar, which I
recognized as belonging to the city, was in my ears.
I perceived I was in bed. A white, narrow bed.
I turned my head slowly and gazed about the room.
It was small and plainly furnished, but seemed
clean and comfortable. The thought forced its
way into my mind that I had never before been in
this room. How, then, did I get there?</p>

<p>I closed my eyes again, and for a long time my
brain refused to grapple with the problem. It
seemed as though coming back from a country
full of mist, and clouds of the mist still clung to it.
Finally, with supreme effort of will, I opened my
eyes again, and again looked through the window<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
and about the room. This time I could think more
clearly. No, I had never been here before, and
the question repeated itself, How, then, did I get
here?</p>

<p>And still I could get no farther than the question.
I heard a door open, and some one tiptoed
to the bedside. I found myself looking up into a
sweet, colorless face. It was surrounded by a
black wimple, and I remembered dimly that I had
seen nuns wearing such. The eyes looked down
for a moment into mine and were then withdrawn.
As I still lay staring at the ceiling, another face
appeared before me. It was the face of a man
whom I did not know. Or, wait a moment, I had
seen it before somewhere, but my brain seemed
to recoil at the effort at recollection.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is doing nicely,&#8221; I heard a voice say. &#8220;He
will soon be quite well. The danger was that he
would never regain consciousness.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again the face was withdrawn, and I felt an
arm under my head lifting me up. A cup was
pressed to my lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Drink,&#8221; said a voice, the man&#8217;s voice, &#8220;it will
do you good.&#8221;</p>

<p>I drank obediently, almost mechanically. Then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
I was lowered again, and the arm was removed.
A great heaviness oppressed my eyelids. I did
not struggle against it, but yielded to it gladly and
drifted away into the land of mist.</p>

<p>When I opened my eyes again the sun was still
shining without the window; nothing in the room
was changed. But my head seemed quite clear and
I could think without weariness. What was this
room in which I found myself? I looked around
and examined it attentively. A small room, twelve
feet square, perhaps, the bed, two chairs, a small
table, and a stove in one corner the only furniture.
There were a number of bottles and glasses on the
table. I raised my hand to my head, surprised at
the effort it cost me, and was astonished to find a
bandage about my forehead. What had happened?
Had I been injured?</p>

<p>And in a flash it all came back to me,&mdash;the
arrest, the ride through the night, the encounter
with Cartouche, the flash of pistols and then darkness.
I must have been wounded in the head. But
the regent,&mdash;was he safe? Richelieu,&mdash;where was
he? A thousand questions surged into my brain
at once. I raised myself upon my elbow and cried
aloud. The door opened in a moment, and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
woman entered, the same woman whose face I
had already seen bending over me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Monsieur is awake, then,&#8221; she said, smiling
at me kindly, but forcing me gently back upon my
pillow. &#8220;Monsieur is better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, I am better,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;But
what has happened? Where am I? The regent,
Richelieu, Madame du Maine&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She laid her hand upon my lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have patience,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I will call the
doctor.&#8221;</p>

<p>She left the room while I still lay overwhelmed
by my thoughts. She was soon back, and with
her was the man who had accompanied her once
before, and this time I recognized him as Levau,
the surgeon who had bound up my shoulder at the
Caf&eacute; Procope.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-morning, M. de Brancas,&#8221; he cried, in
a jovial voice, as he came to my bedside. &#8220;I see
you are doing famously and will soon be on your
feet again. How do you feel?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel no pain,&#8221; I answered, &#8220;but am very
weak.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No pain in the head, eh? Well, that is good.
Come, now, let me see the wound,&#8221; and he untied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
the bandage from about my temples, held up my
head and apparently examined a wound at the
back. &#8220;Upon my word,&#8221; he said, after a moment,
replacing the bandage, &#8220;I have never seen anything
prettier. Ah, monsieur, it is pure blood that
tells, and you are an ideal patient. Why, that
stab you received in the shoulder the other day
has left nothing but a scar, and in a week from
now this little scratch will have ceased to trouble
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what is it?&#8221; I asked, scarcely able to restrain
my impatience while this examination was
in progress. &#8220;I was shot, I know that; but how
did I get here, and where am I and what has been
done with my friends?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One question at a time, M. de Brancas,&#8221; and
Levau stood smiling down at me. &#8220;You were
brought back to Paris from the place on the roadside
where the bullet which struck you in the head
laid you. This is the Hotel Dieu, and you have
to thank the nursing of Sister Angelica here that
you are alive to-day. The bullet did not enter the
skull, but simply stunned you,&mdash;a glance blow. It
looked for a time, however, as though you were
never going to open your eyes again. You had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
also a bullet in your shoulder, but that was a mere
nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How long have I been here, then?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Six days, monsieur,&#8221; and Levau still smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Six days!&#8221; I gasped. &#8220;But tell me, monsieur,
what has become of Richelieu, of Madame du
Maine, and of all the others.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now there, M. de Brancas, you are getting
beyond me,&#8221; and Levau waved his hands deprecatingly.
&#8220;I do not meddle with politics. When
you ask me concerning your injury I have my
answers ready on my lips, but when you go into
politics I am all at sea. But wait a moment,&#8221; he
added, kindly; &#8220;I think I can bring you some one
who has inquired after you every day and who
can answer all these questions,&#8221; and he left the
room. In a moment he returned, bringing with
him a man, who rushed towards my bed, his face
alight with pleasure.</p>

<p>&#8220;D&#8217;Ancenis!&#8221; I cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, de Brancas, it is I,&#8221; and the marquis
took my hand with the heartiest of clasps. &#8220;I
cannot tell how pleased I am to hear that you will
soon be well again. I had just come to inquire
after you when Levau was summoned by the nurse,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
and I was imagining the most horrible things when
he returned with the news that you are so much
better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, monsieur,&#8221; I answered, more
moved than I cared to show by his evident concern.
&#8220;But tell me, where are my friends?&#8221;</p>

<p>D&#8217;Ancenis glanced questioningly at Levau.</p>

<p>The latter nodded encouragingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell him, monsieur,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It will do him
no harm to talk, and worry might retard his recovery,
although the effects of the injury are almost
passed. You will excuse me, gentlemen,&#8221;
and, followed by the nurse, he left the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, then,&#8221; said d&#8217;Ancenis, drawing a
chair to the bedside and again taking my hand.
&#8220;Proceed with your questions, de Brancas.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;First,&#8221; I said, after a moment&#8217;s pause to enable
me to marshal my thoughts in some kind of
order, &#8220;is the regent safe?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite safe,&#8221; and d&#8217;Ancenis smiled more than
ever. &#8220;That night ride of yours, my friend, did
not deserve to be otherwise than successful. I have
heard the regent tell the story a dozen times. He
and his party heard first the rapid beat of horses&#8217;
hoofs. They paused to listen, when from the wood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
in front of them came a rider, clinging to his
horse&#8217;s neck and fired a pistol into the air. There
was a volley of shots behind him and he was seen
to reel and almost fall. He caught himself by a
supreme effort, clung to the saddle until ten paces
from the regent, cried to him to save himself, and
dropped senseless from his horse and rolled to the
side of the road. It was over in a moment, the
scoundrels who had shot him remaining concealed
in the shelter of the trees. The regent, suspecting
some treachery, immediately drew his pistols, as
did the gentlemen with him, and retreated until
some distance from the wood, so that surprise was
impossible. Then a courier from Paris, who had
reached him a few moments before, was sent back
half a league to St. Cloud for re-enforcements. As
soon as these arrived the wood was entered, but
no one was found. The regent examined the body
by the road, and at once recognized you, my friend.
He knew not what to make of it, but ordered you
picked up and brought back to Paris. There he
heard from the commandant of the Versailles gate
how you had got through. A little later, he learned
from me how you had escaped from the hall and
of the efforts made by Madame du Maine to stop<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
you, for she was not so circumspect in this affair
as is usual with her, and betrayed herself completely.
The regent can put two and two together
as well as any man, and he was not long in arriving
at a conclusion. This conclusion became a certainty
when a confession was secured from one of
Cartouche&#8217;s rogues, who attempted to re-enter
Paris the next morning and was captured. He
told all of the details of the ambuscade, and
how Cartouche himself, with his companions, was
to have attacked the regent should he get past the
wood alive. Cartouche has left Paris and is across
the frontier by this time. Really, de Brancas,&#8221;
and d&#8217;Ancenis paused a moment to look at me,
&#8220;you are a devil of a fellow. This was quite in
line with your escape from the Bastille.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Richelieu?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is still in prison, and likely to remain there for
some time to come, to say no worse. His offence
is nothing less than treason, monsieur, and the
regent has sworn to have his head.&#8221;</p>

<p>I groaned aloud.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis what I feared,&#8221; I said. &#8220;I must get up,&#8221;
and I raised myself on one elbow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gently, gently, de Brancas,&#8221; and d&#8217;Ancenis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
pushed me back again, nor did I resist him greatly,
for I was weaker than I had thought. &#8220;Do you
think one man, already half dead, would be able to
liberate Richelieu? You propose to take the Bastille
by storm, I suppose, single-handed and alone.
I should not be surprised to see you undertake such
an exploit.&#8221;</p>

<p>I remained for a moment silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me the rest,&#8221; I said, finally. &#8220;Madame
du Maine, Cellamare, Mlle. de Launay,&mdash;what has
happened to them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cellamare was conducted out of Paris and
started for Spain under a strong escort the morning
after his arrest,&#8221; answered d&#8217;Ancenis. &#8220;He
protested, of course, but it was of no use. The
papers which were found in his possession exposed
all the details of the plot, which was marvellously
well arranged, and which almost makes one admire
the duchess. Madame du Maine submitted very
quietly until she found she was to be taken to the
citadel of Dijon, when she fought like a tigress,
but it was to no avail, and she was safely lodged
in the dungeon, vowing a hundred kinds of vengeance
against her jailers. Mlle. de Launay
wished to accompany her mistress, but the regent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
was afraid to allow those two women to remain
together, so mademoiselle was given a cell in the
Bastille, as were all the other prisoners arrested
at the Tuileries. We found Polignac lying senseless
on the floor, and he was quite hysterical for a
time, protesting his innocence. De Mesmes did the
same, but both were silenced when they were confronted
by their own statements of their share in
the conspiracy. The Duc du Maine was also arrested.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Duc du Maine?&#8221; I cried; &#8220;but he knew
nothing about it. I have never even seen him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can well believe it,&#8221; and d&#8217;Ancenis smiled.
&#8220;I was deputed to arrest him, and I found him
very harmlessly engaged in looking over his collection
of snuffboxes at Sceaux. He was astounded
when I gave him an intimation of what the duchess
had been doing, and was very indignant that she
had caused him to be sent to prison. He was taken
to the Ch&acirc;teau de Dourleans, stopping at every
shrine along the road to pray, for he was firmly
convinced that the regent was going to have him
killed. The regent has little cause to love him, and
will doubtless try to make a case against him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he cannot succeed,&#8221; I said, confidently.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
&#8220;There will be a hundred persons ready to testify
in the duke&#8217;s behalf.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is all the news,&#8221; concluded d&#8217;Ancenis.
&#8220;Paris has been talking of it for a week and the
topic is not yet exhausted. Shall I tell you, my
friend, of what they talk most? It is of your ride,
and there are fifty pretty women ready to worship
you. There has been one in particular who has
made it a point to inquire of me every day how
you are getting on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And who is she?&#8221; I asked, with leaping heart.</p>

<p>D&#8217;Ancenis looked down at me quizzically.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis more serious than I had thought,&#8221; he
said, laughing. &#8220;There will be many to envy you
your good fortune, de Brancas.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But her name?&#8221; I asked again.</p>

<p>&#8220;What, man,&#8221; cried my tormentor, gayly,
&#8220;would you have me be indiscreet? No, no. You
must find out the name for yourself. Ask the lady
of whom you are thinking and see what she says.&#8221;</p>

<p>I caught at his hand, but he eluded me, and
laughed merrily as he looked back from the
door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get well quickly, my friend,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Do
not keep her waiting,&#8221; and he was gone.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>But I did not for a moment question the reply
my heart had given me, and when Levau looked
in on me again a short time later, he found me
looking so contented that he laughed with pleasure.</p>

<p>&#8220;In faith, monsieur,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;I begin to believe
that Captain d&#8217;Ancenis is a better physician
than I. What magic did he use?&#8221;</p>

<p>I merely smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;When can I get out of this?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, we will see about that,&#8221; he answered, his
professional air back upon him in an instant.
&#8220;Three or four days will tell the story.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Three or four days? Nonsense!&#8221; I exclaimed.
&#8220;Why, I am strong enough to get out of bed this
moment,&#8221; and I started as if to rise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Patience, patience, monsieur,&#8221; and Levau held
me back. &#8220;Suppose I say to-morrow, provided
that you pass a good night and are as much
stronger in the morning as I expect you to be?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Agreed. And now cannot I have something
to eat? I am marvellously hungry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As much as you like,&#8221; cried Levau, heartily,
and he hurried away to send my supper to me. I
did it ample justice and enjoyed it greatly, then
lay for a long time thinking over all that d&#8217;Ancenis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
had told me, but more particularly of Louise, and
finally dropped asleep.</p>

<p>I felt like a new man the next morning. Save
for a little soreness at the back of my head and in
my shoulder, and a slight weakness in my legs
when I tried to walk, I was as well as ever. My
clothing was brought me, and I walked around the
room leaning on Levau&#8217;s arm. He seemed indefatigable
in his attentions, and after ten minutes
of this exercise he pronounced himself satisfied
with my condition. Breakfast never tasted better
than did that one, which Levau ate with me, and
as soon as I had swallowed it I was anxious to
depart, for Richelieu&#8217;s danger weighed heavily
upon me, and I knew not how soon the regent
might take action. Cartouche&#8217;s flight from Paris
had cut off all hope of a rescue at the last moment,
even had the scoundrel been inclined to aid me,
which was now exceeding doubtful, and whatever
was to be done must be done by me alone.</p>

<p>After a little demur Levau consented to my departure,
provided I would take his carriage and
not attempt to walk. I agreed, of course, and was
surprised when he prepared to accompany me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it that I am under arrest?&#8221; I asked, an explanation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
for his extreme attentiveness coming to
me suddenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all, monsieur,&#8221; he answered, readily.
&#8220;It is only that I have sworn you shall recover
and that my reputation is at stake. I am not going
to take any chance of failure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope that some day I shall be able to repay
you for your kindness, monsieur,&#8221; I said, moved
by the evident sincerity of the man. &#8220;At present
I am not able to do so, nor to more than thank
the nurse to whom you say I owe my life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Think no more of it, M. de Brancas, I pray
you,&#8221; he protested, with his familiar gesture.
&#8220;Let there be no talk of payment. Indeed, I have
already been more than paid by the persons who
have taken an interest in your case.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And who were they, monsieur?&#8221; I asked, with
some surprise.</p>

<p>But he merely waved his hand again and led me
down to the coach, which was waiting. The
drive across Paris, the fresh air of the morning,
and the sight of the busy city were to me like a
tonic, and I felt my strength returning with every
moment. Levau looked at me with evident satisfaction.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>&#8220;You will do,&#8221; he said. &#8220;With that color in
your cheeks I have no longer any fear for the
result.&#8221;</p>

<p>We soon reached the Hotel de Richelieu, and
the joy of Jacques, who ran down the steps to welcome
me, was touching to see. He would have had
me carried into the house, but I would have none
of it, and insisted on walking in myself. Levau
left me at the door, admonishing me to rest as
much as possible for a day or two, and to summon
him if there were any unfavorable symptoms.
Jacques led the way to the room on the first floor
where I had so often dined. He arranged a chair
for me, brought me a glass of wine, set a stool under
my feet, and would have kissed my hand had I
permitted it.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, there, Jacques,&#8221; I protested, as he asked
me for the hundredth time if there was anything
else he could do for me. &#8220;I am not going to die,
my good friend. In a day or two I shall be well
as ever and then we will see what can be done for
Richelieu.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew you would say that, monsieur!&#8221; he
cried. &#8220;I have heard of your wonderful exploit
of the other evening. Who in Paris has not heard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
of it? Nothing seems to stop you, monsieur, when
once you get started.&#8221;</p>

<p>I thought to myself that the walls of the Bastille
were likely to stop me very effectually, but I did
not want to damp his confidence, so I merely
smiled, and after a time he left me alone while
he went to give orders for dinner.</p>

<p>An hour passed, during which he looked in
upon me once or twice, and I was dozing before
the fire when I heard the door open again. Supposing
it to be Jacques I did not turn, but in an
instant I was startled by a hand upon my shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Richelieu!&#8221; I cried, springing from my chair,
my weakness vanishing as if by magic, and I
caught his hand. &#8220;But what miracle is this?
Have you escaped, man, and in broad daylight?
You must not remain here. Come, a horse, and in
an hour you will be safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, do not fear, de Brancas!&#8221; he exclaimed,
bitterly, dropping into a chair as though utterly
weary. &#8220;I am quite safe. I have no need to leave
Paris.&#8221;</p>

<p>I gazed at him a moment in amazement. Never
had I seen that pleasant face so wretched. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
hair was disordered, his eyes bloodshot, his
clothing disarranged.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; I asked, with a sudden fear at my
heart. &#8220;What has happened?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You do not know, then?&#8221; and he turned his
eyes wearily towards me.</p>

<p>&#8220;On my honor, no.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was the regent who released me,&#8221; and he
paused as one pauses at the brink of a chasm
which must be crossed.</p>

<p>&#8220;The regent?&#8221; I was too astonished to say
more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, the regent. But he had his price. It
was not out of kindness of heart. It was because
he knew that it was worse than death. Do you
know what his price was, de Brancas? I will tell
you. His price was his daughter. To save me
Charlotte has agreed to marry the Duc de Modena.
The marriage takes place to-morrow morning at
the Palais Royal, and she sets out at once for
Italy.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX<br />


<small>THE SECRET STAIRCASE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">I fell</span> back into my chair and gazed at Richelieu
in speechless horror. This was a blow I had not
foreseen and which I was totally unprepared to
meet. The regent, it seemed, had scored a second
time. In fact, he appeared to hold all the winning
cards.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suspected that Orleans would try a game of
this kind,&#8221; continued the duke, after a moment.
&#8220;You remember, I warned you against it, de
Brancas.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I remember,&#8221; I groaned, &#8220;and yet I did
nothing to prevent it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Richelieu arose quickly and came towards me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Believe me,&#8221; he said, taking my hand, &#8220;I am
not blaming you in the least, my friend. But you
have a bandage about your head. You have been
wounded, then? Forgive me for allowing my own
affairs to blind me so.&#8221;</p>

<p>I answered with a pressure of the hand.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>&#8220;You have not heard?&#8221; I asked, quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have heard nothing,&#8221; said Richelieu. &#8220;They
permitted me to receive no one, to speak to no
one. They would not even permit me to wave my
handkerchief to you, as you know. What has
happened?&#8221;</p>

<p>As briefly as I could I told him the story of
Madame du Maine&#8217;s arrest and repeated what I
had already heard from d&#8217;Ancenis.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is all very well,&#8221; said Richelieu, when I
had finished, &#8220;but you have not yet told me how
you received your wound, de Brancas. Come, my
friend, I suspect another of your dare-devil adventures.
Tell me about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>So I told him the story of my night ride and the
rescue of the regent. Richelieu heard me with
sparkling eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twas well done!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;By my word,
I would I had been there. You are right, de Brancas,
assassination is something no gentleman can
countenance. I am surprised that Madame du
Maine should go so far. She must indeed have
been desperate.&#8221; He remained silent for some moments,
musing deeply. &#8220;So the regent was too
quick for us and everything is known,&mdash;even my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
treason, for so it must appear to him. In faith,
I do not wonder he had sworn to have my head.
And yet,&#8221; he added, &#8220;I would he had taken it
rather than that Charlotte should pay this price.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you learn of it?&#8221; I questioned.</p>

<p>&#8220;An hour ago,&#8221; said Richelieu, &#8220;a guard came
to my cell and told me to follow him. I did not
doubt that my destination was the Place de Greve,
but I had found imprisonment so irksome that I
was ready to welcome any change, even the block.
Besides, I was not sorry to have the opportunity
of showing the regent how a gentleman should
die. I was taken to the office of Maison-Rouge
and left there alone with him. He told me that
the regent had ordered my release, and when I
remained too astonished to reply, he handed me a
note.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8217;Tis from the regent,&#8217; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I opened the note, suspecting some new blow.
You may guess my feelings when I saw that it was
a command to be present to-morrow morning at
the Palais Royal to witness the marriage by proxy
of Charlotte and the Duc de Modena. Across the
bottom of the note was written, &#8216;The price paid
for the head of M. le Duc de Richelieu.&#8217; I tore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
the note into a thousand pieces. I told Maison-Rouge
that I would not accept the price and commanded
him to take me back to my cell. He
merely smiled, and said that the price had already
been accepted by the regent, since my head belonged
no longer to me but to him, and calling
two guards, he had me led to the outer gate, which
was closed behind me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll wager &#8217;twas the first time in the history of
the Bastille that a prisoner had to be forced to
leave it,&#8221; I cried. &#8220;Come, monsieur, do not despair.
The regent has overleaped himself in releasing
you so soon. The price may have been
accepted, but it is not yet paid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet paid?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. And furthermore, it need never be paid
if you do not wish it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have a plan, then?&#8221; cried Richelieu, his
face brightening.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, let us have it,&#8221; and he clasped my hand
again. &#8220;I should have remembered that I had
your clear brain and loyal heart still to rely upon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Answer me one question, M. le Duc,&#8221; I said.
&#8220;Suppose the princess and yourself were in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
carriage speeding towards the frontier. Suppose
your flight was not discovered for eight or ten
hours. Do you think you would be safe?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Safe, de Brancas? Why, man, with one hour&#8217;s
start we should be safe. I have a dozen horses
the like of which are not to be found in France,
not even in the regent&#8217;s stables.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And where are these horses?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;In my stables here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, my dear friend,&#8221; I cried, springing to my
feet, &#8220;consider it done. At ten o&#8217;clock to-night
Mlle. de Valois and yourself will set out from
Paris. In two days you will be safe at Mons, that
is, if you are permitted to pass the frontier.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Trust me for that,&#8221; said Richelieu. &#8220;A thousand
pistoles will accomplish wonders. The only
thing I do not understand, my friend, is how you
will manage to get Charlotte into the carriage with
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;M. le Duc,&#8221; I queried, &#8220;do you imagine for a
moment that the thought of this marriage pleases
her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No more than it does myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would she not, then, welcome an opportunity
of escaping it?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>&#8220;Oh, I believe so!&#8221; cried Richelieu.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, trust me, M. le Duc, you shall offer her
that opportunity to-night. But we have no time
to lose and there is much to do. Leave the details
of the plan to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not understand, but I trust you fully, my
friend,&#8221; said Richelieu, and asked no further questions.</p>

<p>A relay of horses was started to St. Quentin and
a second to Compeigne, to await the arrival of the
carriage containing the duke and his companion.
The lightest and most comfortable carriage in his
stables was brought out and thoroughly overhauled.
I myself saw that it was piled with cushions
and equipped with everything that could add
to the comfort or convenience of the travellers. I
provided for every possible contingency of which
I could think, and personally interviewed the man
whom Richelieu had selected to drive until I was
satisfied that he was thoroughly acquainted with
the road and that he was no coward. The tumult
caused by the discovery of the plot had quieted
down, and on inquiry I found that the gates of the
city were again open day and night, so that Richelieu
would have no difficulty in passing the barrier.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
We decided that the carriage should take the most
direct route and trust to speed, as it was important
above everything that it should reach the frontier
ahead of any of the regent&#8217;s emissaries. Richelieu
collected together all the money he had and stored
it in the coach. I added a sword, a brace of pistols,
and a musket, and a similar equipment to the top
of the coach for the use of the driver. To the rear
was strapped a case containing changes of clothing.
At last I could think of nothing more.</p>

<p>All this had taken time, and evening had come
before the final arrangements were completed.
Then Jacques lighted the candles and summoned
us to dinner, a summons which I was not sorry
to obey, for the day&#8217;s work had wearied me
greatly. He had provided a feast of great elaborateness
as a farewell to his master, but Richelieu
seemed too nervous to enjoy it. As for me, I was
so certain of success that I felt no great anxiety.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, this will not do,&#8221; I remonstrated, seeing
that he was merely playing with the food. &#8220;You
must eat, my friend. You will have need of courage
before you reach Mons, and I know of nothing
which so tends to make a coward of a man as an
empty stomach.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>&#8220;You are right,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;but if you knew
the anxiety I am suffering at this moment you
would not expect me to eat. Do you really believe
we shall succeed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;M. le Duc,&#8221; I said, earnestly, &#8220;success will
depend largely upon yourself. I agree to bring
you into the presence of Mlle. de Valois. If you
can persuade her to flee with you, well and good,
we succeed; but if you cannot do this, we must
retire defeated. Come, I drink to your success.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I to yours,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;Forgive me,
de Brancas, for again thinking only of myself. I
hope with all my heart that you will be successful.&#8221;</p>

<p>I bowed with brimming eyes, for he had touched
me closely.</p>

<p>&#8220;It may be long before we dine together again,
monsieur,&#8221; I said. &#8220;May I assure you of my devoted
friendship?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no need of such assurance,&#8221; and Richelieu
arose from his chair and came to the side of
mine. &#8220;I have already had a hundred proofs of
it, in return for which I have done so little.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, do not say that,&#8221; and I faced this man
whom I had come to love with a great tenderness.
&#8220;What should I have done in Paris but for you?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>And as I looked into his eyes I knew that here
was one whose heart was brave and loyal.</p>

<p>Too moved to say more, we continued the meal
in silence, each busy with his own thoughts. Mine
were of Louise Dacour, and I wondered what the
future had in store for us. A sudden thought occurred
to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mlle. Dacour may choose to accompany the
princess,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;And if she does, you will join us, will you not,
de Brancas?&#8221; asked Richelieu, quickly. &#8220;Believe
me, my friend, nothing would please me more than
to have you with me, but I was loath to ask you to
leave Paris while she remained behind.&#8221;</p>

<p>I consented, and it was agreed that I should
join the duke at Brussels within a week if Mlle.
de Valois took her companion with her. And if,
I added to myself, the regent did not see fit to
wreak upon my head the wrath which he would
doubtless feel towards Richelieu. But of this I
said nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure that you are strong enough to
undertake this expedition?&#8221; asked Richelieu, as we
arose from table.</p>

<p>I laughed at him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>&#8220;You shall see, if it comes to a question of using
our swords,&#8221; I said. And then I remembered the
bandage and my hand went to my head. &#8220;I cannot
wear this ridiculous thing, I must remove it,&#8221;
and I started to do so.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not for a moment!&#8221; cried the duke, springing
to my side and seizing my hands. &#8220;Who can tell
what hurt it would do you? Leave it there, Jean,
or I swear I shall not go a step outside this house
to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; and I stopped. I could not tell him that
it was fear of Louise&#8217;s laughing eyes which moved
me.</p>

<p>Richelieu understood in an instant.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is an honorable wound,&#8221; he said, &#8220;received
in an honorable cause. Why seek to hide it? It
is the sight of wounds like that which moves a
woman&#8217;s heart. They will find your pale, bandaged
head very interesting, Jean, believe me.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so I left the bandage where it was.</p>

<p>Nine o&#8217;clock came, the carriage was waiting, we
entered it, and drove by a circuitous route to the
back of the Palais Royal gardens. Here we left it,
and instructed the coachman to drive slowly up
and down until he should be called. That done, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>
led the way under the shade of the chestnuts towards
the palace. Richelieu asked no questions,
but I could see that he was pale with anxiety. We
mounted the low wall enclosing the little park
which we had entered once before under the guidance
of Mlle. Dacour, dropped down on the other
side, and turned to the right.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, ah,&#8221; whispered Richelieu, &#8220;I begin to
see. You hope to gain entrance by the secret staircase.
But can you find the spring?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe so,&#8221; I answered, in the same low
tone. &#8220;I was watching Mlle. Dacour closely when
she opened the door for us, and know about
where it is.&#8221; As I spoke I felt along the wall, but
my fingers detected nothing. &#8220;It was near here.
Have patience,&#8221; I said, for I could feel his hand
on my arm trembling with suspense. Again I
ran my hand over the wall, pressing gently on two
or three small irregularities, but without result.
&#8220;Come, I will try again,&#8221; and a third time I examined
the wall, this time more carefully and over
a larger area. &#8220;Ah, I have it!&#8221; I exclaimed as I
felt a yielding under my fingers, and the door
swung inward.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was time,&#8221; said Richelieu, for as we entered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>
another door near by opened, and hurrying feet
passed along the walk, even as we pushed the door
shut after us. We were in intense darkness, but I
knew the way, and guiding myself by the wall,
turned without hesitation towards the narrow hallway,
Richelieu following close behind, his hand
in mine. We found the hallway without difficulty
and passed along it cautiously until we
reached the end, and slowly felt our way up the
little winding staircase there. The wooden wall
which formed the back of the preserve closet
stopped us.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a moment,&#8221; whispered Richelieu, as I
began to feel for the spring, whose approximate
position I had also seen. &#8220;Does Charlotte know of
this visit?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; I answered; &#8220;I had no opportunity to
warn her of it, else I doubt not she would have
sent some one to guide us and so saved us all
this trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; Richelieu objected, &#8220;perhaps she will
not be alone; perhaps she will resent an intrusion
of this kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; I answered, losing patience a little
at this unexpected wavering, which was so unlike<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>
the duke, &#8220;we can yet turn back, open the door,
return to the carriage, drive to your hotel, and
secure a good night&#8217;s rest before attending the
wedding to-morrow morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Forgive me, de Brancas,&#8221; said Richelieu, after
a moment. &#8220;I am so unstrung I scarce know
what I am saying. Open the door if you can find
the spring.&#8221;</p>

<p>I felt along the boards for two or three minutes
without result. It doubtless seemed an age to
Richelieu, and I could hear him breathing unevenly
and shuffling his feet behind me.</p>

<p>&#8220;For God&#8217;s sake, de Brancas,&#8221; he said at last,
in a strained whisper, &#8220;make haste! This is more
than I can bear.&#8221;</p>

<p>I felt myself beginning to tremble in sympathy
with him, and pulled myself up with a jerk, recognizing
the fact that it was absolutely necessary for
one of us to keep his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;A little patience,&#8221; I whispered; &#8220;this spring
is more difficult to find than the other, and it is so
devilishly dark here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again I ran my hand up and down the wall. It
was made of narrow boards fitted closely together.
Back and forth I passed my hand over it, and just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>
as I was beginning to despair I felt a slight inequality.
I pressed it and the door opened against
us. We stepped back out of the way, and in a
moment were in the closet. The door shut behind
us of its own accord.</p>

<p>The door which opened from the closet into the
room beyond was not tightly closed, and through
this opening we could make a partial survey of the
room. It was empty in so far as we could see, and
I was about to suggest that we make a cautious
scrutiny of the remainder of it, when a sound as
of stifled sobbing startled me.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is that?&#8221; I whispered.</p>

<p>&#8220;My God, do you not know what it is?&#8221; exclaimed
Richelieu. &#8220;It is Charlotte,&mdash;Charlotte
weeping over her coming sacrifice. Stay here, my
friend,&#8221; and before I could do aught to prevent
him he had opened the door, stepped through it,
and closed it behind him. I heard a startled exclamation
from the princess, and at the same instant
another sound which sent a cold shiver down
my back. Some one was ascending the spiral
staircase with assured and regular tread. The
footsteps paused for a moment without the door,
then there came a click, a breath of air, and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>
smell as of a candle newly extinguished. I drew
back into one corner of the closet, and as I did so
this unknown person stepped into it and closed the
secret door behind him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI<br />


<small>WHERE HONOR WINS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">I pressed</span> more closely into my corner and held
my breath in suspense, fearing lest even the beating
of my heart would betray my presence. The new-comer
paused for a moment to set down the lantern,
and in that moment the voice of Richelieu
penetrated to the closet.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are surprised to see me, Charlotte?&#8221; he
was saying. &#8220;Did you think for an instant that
I would permit you to be delivered to this fate
which has been prepared for you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, M. le Duc!&#8221; cried the voice of the princess,
broken by sobs, &#8220;I do but save you from one danger
to find you braving another. You do not
comprehend my father&#8217;s hatred. Go, I beseech
you, before it is too late.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I shall go in a moment, Charlotte,&#8221; answered
Richelieu, in a milder tone, &#8220;and you
are going with me. At the back of the gardens
there is a carriage waiting, with four of the fastest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>
horses in the kingdom. In an hour we shall
be far from Paris. Another day will find us safe
in the Netherlands and free to live our lives together.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a moment&#8217;s silence, and I could hear
the deep, agitated breathing of the person who
stood beside me. My hands began to tremble under
the strain, and I clasped them behind me to
keep them still. An increasing giddiness reminded
me of my wound. The closet was insufferably
close, and my face grew wet with perspiration as
I realized my weakness.</p>

<p>&#8220;And whose plan is this?&#8221; asked Mlle. de
Valois, at last.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you not guess?&#8221; cried Richelieu. &#8220;It
could be only one man,&mdash;the one who found a way
out of the Bastille,&mdash;who has stood between me
and danger a dozen times,&mdash;who even at this moment
is awaiting me in the closet there.&#8221;</p>

<p>I crouched for a spring, expecting an instant
attack from my companion in the closet, and determined
to throttle him at any cost before an
alarm could be given. Even as I steeled myself
for the struggle I heard a startled exclamation at
my side.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>&#8220;Are you indeed here, M. de Brancas?&#8221; whispered
a sweet voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Louise, oh, Louise! is it you?&#8221; I cried, forgetting
caution in the joy and great reaction of this
discovery, and I stretched out my arms and drew
her to me. &#8220;I was just about to spring upon you
to prevent your escape,&#8221; I added, laughing out of
the sheer rapture of my heart.</p>

<p>She did not resist my arms, but, with a long
sigh, laid her head upon my breast. My blood was
surging in my ears as I stooped and kissed her
hair, and I felt that she was sobbing.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, my love?&#8221; I whispered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, do you not know?&#8221; she sobbed. &#8220;Surely
you have heard of the wedding to-morrow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I answered, &#8220;but that wedding will
never take place. By to-morrow Richelieu and
Mlle. de Valois will be far from here, speeding
towards the north of France.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish so with all my heart,&#8221; and Louise drew
back a little, &#8220;but it will never be, M. de Brancas.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What! never be?&#8221; I cried. &#8220;But I tell you
that everything is prepared, that all that remains
to be done is for them to descend, enter the carriage,
and give the word to the driver.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>&#8220;And that is just what Charlotte d&#8217;Orleans will
never do,&#8221; and though her voice was sad, it had
a certain pride and dignity.</p>

<p>I was too astonished to reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;M. de Brancas,&#8221; she continued, &#8220;I know her
better than do you, far better even than Richelieu.
A woman has her ideals no less than a man. But
listen, she herself is telling him.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the tumult of my own emotion I had no
longer heeded what was happening in the outer
room, but at this moment I heard Richelieu&#8217;s voice
raised in impatient protest.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you say, mademoiselle,&#8221; he cried,
&#8220;that you will not go with me? And why, may
I ask? Is it that you no longer love me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;M. le Duc,&#8221; answered the clear voice of the
princess, who seemed to have recovered her composure,
&#8220;it appears to me that it can no longer be a
question of my love, since to save your head I have
agreed to this hateful marriage. The reason is,
monsieur, that I have given my word to my father,
and I do not choose to break it. He might have
distrusted me; he might have insisted that this
marriage take place before you were released, and
I should have consented without an instant&#8217;s hesitation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>
because I should have known that he would
keep faith with me. But he chose to trust me;
you were free again an hour after I had given my
word. It is to his generosity you owe your presence
here to-night, monsieur. My sacrifice may
be the greater, but I do not choose to fall below my
father.&#8221;</p>

<p>Richelieu remained for a moment speechless. I
felt the tears starting to my eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is grand; that is noble,&#8221; I murmured.</p>

<p>Louise answered by a pressure of the hand,
and I knew that she also was affected no less
than I.</p>

<p>It was Richelieu who broke the silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give me a moment for thought, mademoiselle,&#8221;
he said, and we heard him pacing up and
down the room.</p>

<p>As for me, I felt a great reverence for this
woman spring to life in my heart. As I had
told Madame du Maine, a woman may do anything
but break her word; no woman can do that with
honor, no more than any man, and my heart trembled
with emotion as I heard the princess take the
same high ground,&mdash;with her so far above anything
of which I had conceived. I prayed that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>
Richelieu might not fall below her. Louise was
crying softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Charlotte,&#8221; said Richelieu, at last, &#8220;you are
tearing my heart to pieces, and yet I would not
have you other than you are. I was a fool to think
you would consent. But,&#8221; he continued, in a
clearer voice, &#8220;I have given no promise, my honor
is not engaged. I have already refused to accept
this sacrifice. What is there to prevent my taking
you up in my arms, opening the door of yonder
closet, and with de Brancas at my back running
with you to the carriage and starting for the frontier?&#8221;</p>

<p>Again there was a moment&#8217;s silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, no, no!&#8221; she cried, at last. &#8220;Do not tempt
me further, Louis. What I am doing is for my
own honor and for France. My father has told
me that France demands it,&mdash;that it will strengthen
his empire. If you knew how hard it is&mdash;how I
turn with loathing from the task I have to do&mdash;you
would not seek to make it harder.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;De Brancas,&#8221; called Richelieu, &#8220;come here,
my friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>I flung the door open and stepped into the room.
Mlle. de Valois was half sitting, half lying in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>
large chair, her face white with suffering, her eyes
luminous with a great glory. Richelieu himself
was scarcely less affected. He glanced at Louise,
who had come from the closet with me and who
was kneeling at the side of the princess.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;I am glad to see that
you are here, Mlle. Dacour. Charlotte will need
a companion. Will you not accompany her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had intended doing so, M. le Duc,&#8221; answered
Louise, gently, &#8220;whether she went north
or south.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is well,&#8221; and Richelieu bowed to her
with that courtly grace which so well became him.
&#8220;M. de Brancas and myself had already considered
this contingency and he is to join us at Brussels in
a week&#8217;s time.&#8221;</p>

<p>I glanced at Louise to see how she received
this announcement, but seemingly she had not
heard it.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now, de Brancas,&#8221; continued the duke,
turning to me, &#8220;we must make haste. We have
already remained here much too long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;It is your purpose, then,
to forcibly carry away Mlle. de Valois?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Since she refuses to accompany me, yes,&#8221; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>
Richelieu looked me in the eyes. &#8220;Have you any
other course to advise, my friend?&#8221;</p>

<p>I paused irresolute, glancing from one to the
other. I could not choose but speak, whatever the
cost might be.</p>

<p>&#8220;If love were the only thing; if there were not
heights of honor before which love must bow,&#8221; I
said, at last, and paused again. I could not go on.
Let these two hearts settle the future for themselves.
&#8220;M. le Duc,&#8221; I said, in a firmer voice, &#8220;it
is not for me to give advice. I will do whatever
you command.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again Richelieu walked the length of the room,
his twitching face telling of the conflict raging in
his breast. I went to the window and gazed out
upon the night. Louise was sobbing. Only the
princess remained composed. I pray heaven that
my heart may never again be torn as it was in that
moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;M. le Duc,&#8221; she said, in the same calm tone she
had used before, &#8220;listen to the voice of your friend
and to my voice, which, I am sure, finds an answering
chord in your heart. If love were the only
thing I would go with you gladly, but honor must
ever outweigh love in the hearts of all true gentlemen.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>
Tell me, Louis, I have not been deceived
in you,&mdash;that you merit honor no less than love.&#8221;</p>

<p>Richelieu threw himself at her feet with a sob
and caught her hand. I knew he had won the
battle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Forgive me, Charlotte,&#8221; he whispered, in a
choking voice; &#8220;I have played the coward, not
the man. Let it be as you say, your honor and
mine before all else.&#8221;</p>

<p>And at these words my heart went out to him,
and I knew that these two loved each other with
a love in which there was no taint of selfishness.
Years, perhaps, would dull the sting of the wound,
but for them, as for me, life would hold few
sweeter memories than that of this sacred moment.
I could not trust myself to turn from the window.
The lights without were blurred with my tears and
in my heart was a great tenderness.</p>

<p>The princess was the strongest of us all.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must go, my friend,&#8221; she said, at last.
&#8220;My friend I shall always deem you,&mdash;my nearest
and dearest friend,&mdash;who stood true to me in the
bitterest hour of my life. Look up,&mdash;here, in my
eyes. Do you see any sorrow there? Sorrow
there may have been,&mdash;sorrow there may be again,&mdash;but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>
now it is swallowed up by joy and pride in
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>I turned to look at them. It must have been
with faces so transfigured that martyrs went to the
stake,&mdash;yea, Christ to His cross.</p>

<p>Her arms were around his neck, and she bent
her head and kissed him.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the last,&#8221; she said,&mdash;&#8220;the last I shall willingly
give,&#8221; and she gently loosed his hands, arose,
and stood from him.</p>

<p>&#8220;We, also, must say good-by,&#8221; said a low voice
at my elbow, and I turned with a start to see
Louise standing there.</p>

<p>&#8220;You, too, are going?&#8221; I cried, with a great
fear at my heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it is settled,&#8221; and she was looking into
my eyes. &#8220;My place is at her side. But my sacrifice,
my friend, is much less than hers. I am leaving,
perhaps, people whom I love, but there is no
abyss at the end of the path such as yawns before
Charlotte.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; I answered, &#8220;no,&#8221; but I could say no
more.</p>

<p>&#8220;And believe me, M. de Brancas,&#8221; she continued,
placing both her hands in mine, &#8220;nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span>
that you have ever done&mdash;not even that bandage
about your head which tells of a wound so nobly
won&mdash;has pleased me as did the words you said
to Richelieu. I read your heart, and I saw nothing
there but loyalty and truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>I gazed into her eyes, which she did not seek to
turn from mine, trembling in every limb,&mdash;trembling
too much to speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may kiss me,&#8221; she whispered, and I bent
and kissed her on the lips. &#8220;Now go, and let
that be your accolade for the knightly spirit you
have shown to-night. Oh, do not seek to hide the
tears. I could not love a man who had not a tender
heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>She pushed me gently from her. I turned to
find that Richelieu had also risen and was waiting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, my friend,&#8221; he said, &#8220;let us go,&#8221; but
he did not take his eyes from the princess, who
was standing, pale, lovely, with the air of a general
who has fallen mortally wounded at the moment
of victory.</p>

<p>I went to her and knelt as at a shrine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mademoiselle,&#8221; I said, &#8220;I cannot hope to tell
you how great a reverence you have inspired in
my heart to-night, but I trust that if you are ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>
in need of a sword and a loyal heart you will remember
me. I can think of no greater honor than
that of serving you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall remember, M. de Brancas,&#8221; she answered,
smiling down upon me and giving me her
hand. &#8220;I know you for a brave gentleman and
faithful friend. I shall not soon forget it.&#8221;</p>

<p>I kissed her hand and stood erect once more.
Plainly it was time to go, and with a last glance
at my love, I laid my hand on Richelieu&#8217;s arm and
drew him towards the closet. He yielded without
a word. Only when the door had closed behind
us did he falter, but I pressed him on, down the
spiral staircase, along the little hall, and through
the outer door. He started as it clicked shut behind
us and leaned against the wall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I can go no farther, de Brancas!&#8221; he
exclaimed. &#8220;Think to what fate I am abandoning
her. She may be brave now, perhaps,
but what of the days and the years that are yet
to come?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is as she would wish,&#8221; I answered, gently.
&#8220;Come, we must not remain here.&#8221;</p>

<p>I led him to the low wall, which we climbed a
second time, along the avenue of chestnuts and to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span>
the street beyond. The carriage was awaiting us.
I called the driver.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will return to the Hotel de Richelieu,&#8221; I
said, and entered after the duke.</p>

<p>The way seemed interminably long, nor did I
venture to offer any further sympathy to the
stricken man in the other corner. My own heart
was sore enough, not only with his sorrow but
with my own.</p>

<p>Jacques met us at the steps. One glance at his
master&#8217;s face told him the story.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will drive to the stables,&#8221; he said to the
coachman. &#8220;I will soon join you there,&#8221; and he
followed us within and shut the door.</p>

<p>Richelieu paused a moment on the stairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will go to my room, de Brancas,&#8221; he said, in
a weary voice. &#8220;I wish to be alone, my friend,&#8221;
and he went on up the stairs. I watched him until
he disappeared from sight, and then turned into a
room on the lower floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Send him up a bottle of wine, Jacques,&#8221; I said.
&#8220;He needs it now as he never did before in his
life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has lost, then, M. de Brancas?&#8221;</p>

<p>I glanced at his honest face.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span>&#8220;Yes, he has lost in a way,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;But
he has also won a great victory, my friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He had not the air of a victor, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Jacques,&#8221; and I smiled rather grimly,
&#8220;there are some victories which cost the victor
more than the vanquished. This was one of that
kind. But they are victories just the same,
Jacques, though men, sometimes, do not so consider
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>I turned to the fire and sat down before it.
This, then, was the end. And was it the end, also,
of my love for Louise Dacour? When should I
see her? What did the future hold for us? I
gazed into the depths of the glowing embers and
saw again her sweet face looking up at me, her
eyes on mine, and I knew that come what might
that vision would never leave me. The clock
chimed midnight, and as I started bedward, I
heard Richelieu walking back and forth in the
room overhead. And a great wave of pity for
him swept over me as I thought of the battle he
was fighting and the ordeal he had yet to face.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII<br />


<small>AT THE PALAIS ROYAL</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">I had</span> scarce opened my eyes the next morning
when there came a rap at the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in!&#8221; I cried.</p>

<p>The door opened and Jacques entered.</p>

<p>&#8220;An order for you, M. de Brancas,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;left here a moment ago by one of the regent&#8217;s
guards,&#8221; and he handed me a folded paper.</p>

<p>I opened it with a trembling hand. What new
move was this?</p>

<p>&#8220;M. de Brancas,&#8221; I read, &#8220;will be in the chapel
of the Palais Royal at nine o&#8217;clock this morning.
He will accompany the Duc de Richelieu, and will
not leave until the ceremony which is to take place
at that hour has been concluded. He will then
proceed directly to the private audience-chamber.
Signed, Orleans, Regent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis hardly a new calamity, Jacques,&#8221; I said,
seeing his anxious face, &#8220;but it may presage one.
Is Richelieu awake?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is in the dining-hall awaiting you, monsieur.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span>&#8220;Tell him I will join him in a moment,&#8221; and
leaping out of bed, I was soon dressed and downstairs.</p>

<p>I looked at the duke anxiously as I advanced to
take his hand, and was pleased to note that his
face showed less disorder than I had feared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, do not look so depressed, my friend!&#8221; he
cried, rising to meet me. &#8220;I have finished the battle,
and I fancy you will no longer find me the
foolish and vacillating creature of last night. At
least, I shall be strong enough to say yes or no.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is well, monsieur,&#8221; I said, but I glanced
at him with some concern, for his gayety seemed
feverish. I judged it best to say nothing on that
score, however, and we sat down to breakfast
together, the duke maintaining a rapid flow of
conversation which awakened in me still more
uneasiness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I received an order this morning from the regent,&#8221;
I said, at last, &#8220;commanding me to accompany
you to the Palais Royal this morning at nine
o&#8217;clock. If you think the sight will prove too
painful, you could easily feign illness, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; and Richelieu grew grave in a moment.
&#8220;I shall go, my friend, and prove to Charlotte<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[343]</span>
that I am not the coward she must think
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it seems an unnecessary trial for both of
you,&#8221; I protested.</p>

<p>&#8220;The regent has ordered it, de Brancas,&#8221; answered
Richelieu, quietly; &#8220;and do you know why
he has ordered it? Simply to give me pain. Ah,
well, I will show him that I can smile even when
my heart is breaking.&#8221;</p>

<p>He fell silent for a time and then suddenly arose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we have no time to lose. It
will be a brilliant assembly and we must pay some
attention to our toilettes. You are to consider
mine as your own, my friend. All I have would
be too little to show my gratitude.&#8221;</p>

<p>I thanked him, but declined his offer. I was
resolved to wear no borrowed plumage, but to go as
plain Jean de Brancas. Richelieu looked at me
with a smile as he joined me in the hall,&mdash;a smile
of understanding,&mdash;but he said nothing. We entered
the carriage which was waiting and were
driven rapidly across the Seine. I glanced at him
anxiously. He appeared more composed than I.</p>

<p>There was a blockade of vehicles in the Rue St.
Honor&eacute; and we could proceed but slowly. Richelieu<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span>
seemed rather to court than to shun observation
and nodded gayly to all whom he knew. But
every journey must have an end, and at last we
drew up before the entrance to the Palais Royal,
crossed the court, and mounted the steps together.
The chapel was already crowded with a gay company,
and they seemed to turn their heads with one
accord and look at us as we entered. Some whisper
had got abroad of Richelieu&#8217;s love for the princess,
and every one was curious to see how he
would endure the ordeal. My heart leaped as I
saw him advancing with head erect and eyes sparkling,
bowing gayly to right and left. It was as I
would have a brave man go to the block. He took
his station at the side of Mlle. de Charolais, the
regent&#8217;s sister, in the front rank of the spectators,
and began a lively conversation with her. I had
not his confidence in my power to conceal my feelings,
and chose a less conspicuous position somewhat
in the rear.</p>

<p>We had not long to wait. A sudden silence fell
upon the crowd, and before the altar appeared the
priest, vested in surplice and white stole. At either
side of him came the acolytes and choir boys, and
even as they took their places the bridal procession<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[345]</span>
entered. I who was standing behind Richelieu
saw the nervous energy with which he gripped his
sword, but his lips still smiled even when the bride,
conducted by the regent, passed in her wedding
finery. I gazed at her with bated breath. Her face
was white as her wedding-gown and her eyes were
lustrous and dark and full of high purpose. I had
never seen her so beautiful.</p>

<p>My eyes turned from her to the lady following,
and with a start I recognized Louise. She, too,
was pale, and I saw that her lips were trembling,
but she went bravely on, looking neither to the
right nor to the left. The crowd of courtiers and
powdered ladies closed in behind her, and I dimly
remember hearing some one say that the ceremony
was to be the simplest possible, that the bride had
so ordered it.</p>

<p>The murmur of the crowd died away to a whisper,
to profound silence, broken only by the voice
of the priest. I felt my head whirling and my
hand trembling like a leaf. And then came the
voice of the princess, calm, clear, firm, and my
eyes were wet with tears. I dared not glance in
Richelieu&#8217;s direction. I feared that even yet he
might attempt to drag her from the altar. Above<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[346]</span>
the beating of my heart arose the voice of the
priest,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ego conjungo vos in matrimonium, in nomine
Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sanctu.&#8221;</p>

<p>And it was done. I know not what I had expected,&mdash;a
bolt from heaven, perhaps&mdash;some warning
of divine displeasure,&mdash;but in my heart I had
not until this moment believed that this marriage
was to be. What followed I do not know. I
heard a confused sound of chanting far in the distance;
the odor of incense was in my nostrils. A
movement in the crowd jostled me rudely, and as
the people fell back to right and left I saw again the
victim of this sacrifice, her eyes more luminous, her
face more livid, but her head no less erect, her
step no less firm. At her side was a dark and
swarthy man whom I had never seen before, but
whom I knew to be the representative of the Duc
de Modena, for the marriage had been by proxy.
They passed down the aisle and out of sight.</p>

<p>I stood as a man dazed. I could not believe that
what I had witnessed had really happened. It
seemed that I must be dreaming. A touch on the
arm aroused me, and I turned to find Richelieu
at my side.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span>&#8220;Come, my friend,&#8221; he said, smiling sadly, &#8220;I,
too, have just received an order from the regent.
It is to join my regiment at Bayonne without delay.
A guard of horse awaits me at the door.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you will go?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;I shall be glad to get
away from Paris for a time. There is nothing but
sad memories here for me. You are to make my
house your home,&#8221; he continued, earnestly. &#8220;Perhaps,
some time, you may even care to join me at
Bayonne. Good-by, my friend,&#8221; and as though
unable to say more, he pressed my hand and hurried
towards the door.</p>

<p>I gazed after him until he had disappeared in
the crowd, and I wondered sadly what I should do
alone in Paris. Without Richelieu and without
Louise my life would indeed be aimless and void of
interest. I watched the crowd as it gradually dispersed.
More than one curious glance was shot
in my direction, but no one spoke to me, and the
chapel soon became deserted.</p>

<p>A voice at my side startled me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Monsieur has an appointment with the regent,
has he not?&#8221; asked the voice, and I turned and saw
one of the ushers of the palace.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[348]</span>&#8220;Yes; I had forgot it,&#8221; I answered, remembering
in a moment the order I had received ere I
was out of bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will conduct monsieur to the audience-chamber,&#8221;
he said, and at a gesture of assent he led the
way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know when Mlle. de Valois leaves?&#8221;
I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Duchess de Modena leaves at once for
Italy to join her husband.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True,&#8221; I murmured, &#8220;she is no longer Mlle.
de Valois,&#8221; and I followed him in silence. I was
not, then, to see Louise again. There was no room
in my heart for any other thought. I was crushed,
hopeless. My guide opened the door into the
audience-chamber which I knew so well. He stood
aside and I entered. A glance showed me that the
room was empty.</p>

<p>&#8220;The regent requests you to await him here,
monsieur,&#8221; said the usher, and closed the door.</p>

<p>I sank into a chair, utterly weary and disheartened.
Never, even at Poitiers, had my life appeared
so barren and so fruitless. I felt as a shipwrecked
man must feel who is left alone in the
midst of a great waste of water, without a spar to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span>
cling to, without a hope of succor,&mdash;overwhelmed,
impotent, a pigmy. I comprehended dimly that I
had been struggling against a force greater than
I had understood,&mdash;a force that had brushed me
aside out of its path without seeing me,&mdash;a force
against which my puny strength counted as less
than nothing.</p>

<p>The opening of a door aroused me, and I arose
as I saw the regent enter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down, M. de Brancas,&#8221; he said, kindly,
himself taking the large chair in which he always
sat. &#8220;This is to be a friendly conference, I trust,&#8221;
and he smiled at me, though, I fancied, sadly.
&#8220;This is the first time I have seen you since you
dashed out of the wood with Cartouche&#8217;s rascals
at your heels, and I see that your wound is not
yet well. Believe me, monsieur, I am not ungrateful
for the valor you showed that night, and I
appreciate and respect the feeling which sent you
to my rescue.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twas what any gentleman would have done,&#8221;
I said, simply, and that night seemed far away.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twas what any gentleman would have tried
to do, perhaps,&#8221; answered the regent, &#8220;but which
few could have accomplished. Do not belittle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[350]</span>
yourself, M. de Brancas. I admire strong men
who pause at nothing, even though they be against
me. Few could have done what you have done
since you have been in Paris.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And to what end?&#8221; I cried. &#8220;Everything that
I have done, every hope that I have cherished, was
blown into thin air this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is one thing which even the bravest men
assault in vain,&#8221; and the regent&#8217;s manner had a
certain majesty which became him well. &#8220;That
is the state. They may break themselves against it
as they will, they may think that they have victory
within their grasp, but in the end the state stands
firm, unshaken. It cannot stop to examine every
heart, M. de Brancas. It must move steadily forward
towards the goal it has in view. Some hearts
may be crushed, some lives embittered, but the
state lives, and the state is above everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But did the state demand this sacrifice?&#8221; I
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;The state demanded it, yes, M. de Brancas,&#8221;
and a cloud descended upon the regent&#8217;s face. &#8220;I
love my daughters, monsieur. I do not delight in
torturing them. But the father must yield to the
regent, just as the man must yield to the state. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[351]</span>
tell you plainly that no other price could have
bought the head of Richelieu. I was determined
that no member of my house&mdash;the reigning house&mdash;should
continue a liaison with a traitor. I was
determined that treason should not be permitted
to conceal itself behind the throne, ready to hurl
it down at any moment; and had there been no
other way, that traitor&#8217;s head should have fallen
on the Place de Greve as a warning to other traitors.
But there was another way, and it has been
accomplished. A severed neck has never been
known to heal, monsieur, but broken hearts are not
so fatal, for Time is a wonderful surgeon. I will
govern France with justice and kindness if I can;
but when treason raises its head, I will strike and
without mercy. Above everything, it shall be I
who governs France, and no one else. My daughter&#8217;s
marriage with this Italian prince has strengthened
France, and she needs all the strength the
devotion of her subjects can give her.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused for a moment, the cloud still on his
brow.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have doubtless heard many stories about
me, M. de Brancas,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;Some of
them are true, perhaps, but there is one which is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[352]</span>
not true. It is the most monstrous of all. Chancel
has made the most of it in his last philippic.&#8221;</p>

<p>I knew what he meant. Indeed, I had heard
Chancel reciting it at the house of Madame du
Maine, and had turned away in disgust at the
statement that Orleans aimed to poison the king
and seize the throne himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I tell you what is the greatest ambition of
my life? It is to place in the hands of Louis XV.,
when he ascends the throne, a kingdom greater
than the one which I now hold in trust; a kingdom
free from debt and from the abuses which grind
the people into the earth. I may have mistresses,
M. de Brancas, but no one has ever yet been able
to say truthfully that I deliver the kingdom into
their hands, as other and greater rulers than I have
done.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had risen as he spoke, and at these words he
stood beside my chair and laid his hand upon my
shoulder. I was strangely moved. Assuredly
there was no enmity in my heart for this man,
however great the sorrow he had caused my
dearest friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know why I tell you this,&#8221; he continued,
in a calmer voice, &#8220;unless it be that I know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[353]</span>
you for a brave and loyal gentleman, with whom
I am proud to measure myself. The bravest act of
all, monsieur, was the one you did last night in the
apartments of my daughter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You knew of it, then?&#8221; I asked in wonderment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I knew of it,&#8221; and the regent smiled with
a brighter face. &#8220;My daughter came to me after
you had gone and told me of it,&mdash;not to ask anything
for herself, monsieur, but to ask something
for some one else whom she loves. And I was
proud of my daughter,&mdash;how proud I cannot tell
you,&mdash;and I promised her that what she asked
should be done. Indeed, I had already thought of
it before she asked.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Richelieu also deserves some praise, monsieur,&#8221;
I said. &#8220;He chose the nobler part.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but required prompting in it,&#8221; answered
the regent, quickly. &#8220;However, he has his reward,
monsieur. I had intended banishing him
as a firebrand dangerous to the peace of the kingdom.
Instead, I have merely sent him to Bayonne,
and will soon release him even from there. The
reward is for others, monsieur, who behaved more
nobly still.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[354]</span>I gazed at him in astonishment too deep for
words, for this was not the Philip d&#8217;Orleans whom
I had known and whom the world knew. This
was a handsome gentleman with smiling lips and
brilliant eyes, a man whose whole appearance was
singularly winning.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is yet wanting one person to our conference,&#8221;
he said, after a moment. &#8220;That person
will soon be here. In fact, she is coming now.&#8221;</p>

<p>I heard the door open behind me,&mdash;the rustle of
a dress. My heart told me who it was. I sprang
from my chair and faced Louise Dacour.</p>

<small>THE REGENT&#8217;S GRATITUDE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">She</span> wore the same gown in which she had followed
the princess to the altar, and there were
traces of tears upon her face. She walked straight
to the regent, without glancing in my direction.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, monsieur?&#8221; she cried, &#8220;what is it
that has separated me from Charlotte at this last
moment?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And did she tell you nothing?&#8221; asked the regent,
kindly.</p>

<p>&#8220;She told me only that it had been done at her
request and that she wished it. She bade me
good-by at her carriage window, and said that you
would explain it all to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And so I shall,&#8221; said the regent. &#8220;You would
wish to do what my daughter desires you to do,
would you not, mademoiselle, and what you knew
would make her happier?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, M. le Duc, can you ask?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I do not need to ask,&#8221; and the regent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[356]</span>
smiled into her anxious face. &#8220;Only, before beginning,
I wish to assure you, mademoiselle, that
that which follows is really what my daughter
does wish, and what will, I am certain, truly make
her happier. You will believe this, mademoiselle?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will try to do so,&#8221; and Louise looked at him
wonderingly. Evidently she, also, was not acquainted
with this man of kindly face and tender
voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down, then, mademoiselle,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and
you also, M. de Brancas. What I have to say
will take some time and I do not wish to weary
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>We did as he bade, and I gazed at Louise with
all my love in my eyes, but she did not vouchsafe
me a glance.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must commence first with M. de Brancas,&#8221;
and the regent picked up some papers which were
lying on the table at his elbow. &#8220;I pray neither
of you to interrupt me until I have finished. This
paper which I hold in my hand is the report of the
Marquis d&#8217;Ancenis, captain of the guards. It informs
me that among the gentlemen who were
found in the salon of Madame du Maine on the
night of the discovery of the plot was a certain M.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[357]</span>
Jean de Brancas. It adds that there can be no
possible doubt of his complicity in the plot, that
he had been aware of all its details for several
days, that he was present at a conference between
Mlle. de Launay and Prince Cellamare, that on
that occasion he resisted and dangerously wounded
one of M. H&eacute;rault&#8217;s agents, that he subsequently
caused to be delivered to M. H&eacute;rault a number
of spurious papers for the purpose of misleading
him, and that he has, in a word, been guilty of
treason.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, M. le Duc&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; protested Mlle. Dacour.
The regent stopped her with a gesture.</p>

<p>&#8220;M. de Brancas has, then, been guilty of the
gravest crime which can be charged against a subject
of France,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;All persons who
conspire against the kingdom must be punished.
To this there can be no exception. All of the other
conspirators have been imprisoned. M. de Brancas
must therefore be imprisoned. Some of the
other conspirators must lose their heads. M. de
Brancas&#8217;s further punishment has also to be considered.&#8221;</p>

<p>At last she looked at me,&mdash;only a glance, but a
glance that made my heart leap.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[358]</span>&#8220;And have you brought me here to torture me?&#8221;
she cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have patience,&#8221; and the regent smiled down
again into her upturned face. &#8220;You will learn in
a moment, mademoiselle. This,&#8221; he continued,
picking up another paper, &#8220;is a second report concerning
M. de Brancas. It relates how he escaped
from the salon by overturning two of the guards,
mounted a horse and rode away no one knew
whither, evading two volleys which were fired after
him. Here is a third report, stating that Madame
du Maine endeavored to prevent his escape, and
furnished a description of the horse and rider,
which was sent to all the gates of Paris, and especially,
at her urgent request, to the Versailles gate.
This paper is the report of the commandant of the
Versailles gate. It relates how M. de Brancas arrived
at the gate in the guise of a courier, having
in some way obtained the pass-word; how, in the
instant that an attempt was made to arrest him,
he rode down a sentry, forced open the gate, and
plunged into the outer darkness. The report adds
that a volley of musketry was fired after him, but
that he apparently escaped uninjured, and that the
absence of horses prevented a pursuit. Here is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[359]</span>
report from Levau, chief surgeon of the Hotel
Dieu, to whom this case was especially intrusted.
It states that M. de Brancas was brought there suffering
from a pistol-shot in the head and another
in the shoulder, that he recovered from both
wounds and was discharged practically well again.&#8221;</p>

<p>The regent paused and I got another glance
from Louise. She was breathing more freely and
the color was returning to her face. What cared
I for the regent if only she loved me?</p>

<p>&#8220;But the most important report of all is not
here,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;That is my report, which,
however, has never been put into writing. It is
that on this same night I was returning to Paris
from Versailles, where some business had summoned
me. I had passed St. Cloud, when out of
the wood ahead rode a madman, who fired a pistol
into the air, cried to me to save myself, and rolled
lifeless into the road. The report would add that,
upon examination, this madman was found to be
the same M. de Brancas concerning whom so many
reports have already been written. The report
would conclude by stating that a plot to assassinate
me was subsequently discovered.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again the regent paused for a moment. Ah!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[360]</span>
the joy in my heart when Louise looked at me a
third time,&mdash;this time almost with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;In other words,&#8221; went on the regent, &#8220;the object
of this mad ride through the night, this overcoming
of so many obstacles, this encountering
of so many perils,&mdash;in short, this achievement almost
superhuman,&mdash;was to save my life from a
band of murderers. For this I am grateful, and
I intend to show my gratitude. This, M. de Brancas,&#8221;
and he picked up another paper, &#8220;is the title
to a pretty little estate in Normandy. It is called
Arneaux. This title, monsieur, I give you, and I
instruct you to set out for your estate as soon as
possible. It is upon your estate that I propose to
imprison you.&#8221;</p>

<p>I took the paper, too stupefied to speak. An
estate for me&mdash;for me, Jean de Brancas!</p>

<p>&#8220;But this is more than I merit, monsieur,&#8221; I
stammered. He silenced me with a gesture.
Louise was beaming at me, her eyes bright with
tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was at this point,&#8221; continued the regent,
whose face grew ever more smiling, &#8220;that my
daughter came to my assistance. It was last night
that she knocked at the door of my apartment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[361]</span>
and after she had entered, she told me of an act
of loyalty before which I count all this as nothing.
She told me of a man who held honor above love
and friendship, and of a woman who held loyalty
and honor above love. Believe me, monsieur and
mademoiselle, there are not many such. And in
return for this my daughter suggested that I also
appoint a jailer for M. de Brancas.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, M. le Duc,&#8221; protested Louise, &#8220;M. de
Brancas does not need a jailer. His simple word
of honor, it seems to me, should be sufficient.&#8221;</p>

<p>I confess my head was in a whirl. I knew not
what to think.</p>

<p>&#8220;So I thought,&#8221; answered the regent, &#8220;and
so I told my daughter, but I was silenced when
she told me whom she wished me to name as
jailer. I have made out the appointment here.
You will see it is in due form. &#8216;I, Philip d&#8217;Orleans,
Regent of France, in the name of His Most
Gracious Majesty, Louis XV., of France, do this
day appoint as jailer of M. Jean de Brancas, to
securely guard upon his estate at Arneaux by whatever
means may seem necessary, one Mlle. Louise
Dacour&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Louise uttered a cry of astonishment. I was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[362]</span>
on my feet in an instant. The regent silenced us
both with another wave of the hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;The only condition being,&#8217;&#8221; he continued,
&#8220;&#8216;that Mlle. Dacour shall be united in marriage
to the prisoner, M. de Brancas, in order that she
may be able to guard him more effectually at all
times. Signed, Philip d&#8217;Orleans, Regent of
France.&#8217; Now, M. de Brancas, we will hear you
first. Is it that you object to this jailer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, M. le Duc,&#8221; I answered, not daring to
glance at Louise. &#8220;God knows, I would willingly
spend my whole life in such a prison. But I ask
no assistance in love, monsieur, nor do I wish any
woman, however much I love her, to be compelled
to marry me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The regent looked at me for a moment with a
smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;And who has said anything about compulsion,
my friend?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Certainly, not I. It is
for Mlle. Dacour to choose. I fancy you would
suffer little with such a jailer, but if she does not
desire the position, she has only to refuse it.&#8221;</p>

<p>I turned to Louise. She, too, had risen, and
her face was rosy with blushes and tender with
a great tenderness. She was looking at me with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[363]</span>
brimming eyes. For a moment I did not understand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Louise!&#8221; I cried, &#8220;Louise!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;M. le Duc,&#8221; she said, with the prettiest bow in
the world, &#8220;I believe I will accept the trust.&#8221;</p>

<p>In an instant she was in my arms, and the regent,
with smiling face, left us alone together.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">A LAST WORD</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> roses are blooming about me in this little
garden in Normandy, for it is June, and six months
have gone since that memorable audience with the
regent,&mdash;six months that have passed like a dream.
I have been busy looking over my estate&mdash;how
strangely it sounds, even yet, to say &#8220;my estate!&#8221;&mdash;getting
acquainted with my people and trying
to make them love me.</p>

<p>I receive a letter from Paris now and then, and
from these I learn the news. Madame du Maine
is still at Dijon, and the other conspirators are also
still in prison, but the regent is not vindictive, and
I believe will soon release them. To the Bretons
he was not so merciful, and more than one went to
the gibbet. But the kingdom is at peace, and we
hear no more of plots against it.</p>

<p>I close my eyes, and see again the lovely face
of Charlotte d&#8217;Orleans as I saw it last and as I love
best to remember it, and I pray that it may yet be
my good fortune to be of service to her. Stranger
things have happened, and, who knows, perhaps
some day the chance will come.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[365]</span>And Richelieu? Ah, Richelieu is coming next
week to be my guest, and how I shall delight to
take him by the hand, to show him over my estate,
to talk with him again!</p>

<p>As I lay down my pen I hear a stealthy step
upon the walk behind me, and two soft hands are
clasped upon my eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess who it is,&#8221; cries a merry voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not need to guess, my love,&#8221; I answer.
&#8220;My heart tells me too surely,&#8221; and I draw my
wife&#8217;s laughing face down to mine and kiss her
fondly.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
